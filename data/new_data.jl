{"text": "It is a great satisfaction to see Destiny 2 coming here on Steam and, even more, for bringing much of its content as \"Free-to-Play\". We have a much larger and more active community here, including veterans and new players! And despite the chaos that was its \"relaunch\" here, it is already much more stable and normalized. It is indeed F2P, but to some extent, isn't it? The new content will be paid for. But I assure you that there is so much to do and explore that you will have an excellent experience and guaranteed fun before you even consider reaching the contents of the new expansions. So much that it can be quite confusing for new players. Today the game has a new dynamic and is practically all focused on multiplayer cooperation and its journeys, leaving the campaign as an option. They called this new format \"The New Light\". This pleased a good part of its players, but not everyone is 100% satisfied (it will be a matter of getting used to it). I'll try to summarize what, at least, I thought was worth highlighting in this change: are you a new player? If you care,. You will not regret! Run after Amanda Holiday and unlock one campaign at a time and proceed. At least the first: \"The Red Legion\". It is a very interesting adventure, very fun and offers excellent content, I guarantee! It is simply an experience that every Destiny 2 player has to experience at least once. In addition, it will present all the characters, enemies and mechanics of the game in a natural way (except that you will already have all the skills at your disposal). After that, you will have the Destiny universe in your hands and you can get a bullet through everything and everyone in the name of the Traveler. is a Shooter with RPG elements focused on frantic action with rain of bullets from all sides. And with very well implemented mechanics, by the way, because the control of movement and shooting will be dominated naturally by you during gameplay without great difficulties .. the detail that differs how each one will play is given by which class of character choose, because each has a certain peculiarity. And, no joke: the game is visually VERY BEAUTIFUL .. you will find yourself admiring the scenery several times. In addition, the game is full of memorable characters and impeccable voice acting for our native language. Speaking of, quickly, the story revolves around the \"Traveler\". An entity that brought life and prosperity to everything its light reached, for centuries ... considered a divine being by those who live under its guard. That was until the beginning of Destiny 2 and before all the content it throws in your chest. The campaign itself lasts approximately 10 hours, apart from the two expansions \"The Curse of Osiris\" and \"The Warlike Mind\" that can deliver another 5h ~ 6h of gameplay, and that's all free, not to mention of the time you will spend \"playing\" around the places exploring some small areas of interest, carrying out Sidequests, annihilating aliens and participating in public events that occur during the maps from time to time ... in short, the \"farm\" itself. It is possible for you to go over 60 hours and not even notice. But, if you are not interested in the campaign, there is no lack of post-game content here. There are several events that can be explored, but the main ones are, quite briefly: In the end, know that they will end up becoming repetitive. But until you start to get sick, you will experience a lot of epic things. So, if you just want to have fun, this new journey from Bungie here on Steam offers a full plate for a lot of people who want high quality content without having to pay a penny ... either for those who care about the campaign or not. But again, I strongly recommend following the campaign! The new content Forsaken and Shadowkeep bring very interesting content and, if you liked what you were, I recommend purchasing it at a favorable opportunity for you. In addition, this was a game that offered me a very rewarding experience, guaranteeing hours and hours of fun and I didn't even play \"for real\".

The first thing that caught my attention is the artistic design of it, full of completely straight lines, something that personally seems to me to be even a step ahead of the term \"minimalist\". The music is somewhat curious, a kind of film soundtrack from the 1920s; Although it is not bad and there are times when it does not even sound, it accompanies quite well. As for what comes to the heart of the game (that is, the puzzles), fortunately they are quite consistent and are not crazy inventions as in others. It is marked by humor, although it is too short to become fond of the character enough. As an extra, it includes a mini-adventure (yes, more so) about one of the secondary characters. In general you could say that it is good to hang out. The base price seems excessive to me, it would be more interesting to wait for an offer or pack with the continuation.

{"text": "This is an assessment of the campaign  Starting off with the technical aspects Doesn't seem like much was done to improve the original. I still get tearing on my G-Sync monitor so I had turn put on fast sync to avoid it entirely and there is still no FOV slider for campaign that is but as far as graphical presentation, there is clearly a descent upgrade. Much more colourful and vibrant colours as supposed to the constant greys and browns on the original but this game weirdly enough, has reasons why it's a good sequel and why it isn't.  This is up for you to decide campaign-wise starting off with the negatives:  1) Game play in this one felt far more directed towards action which inevitably hurt the series later down the road  2) Game play also felt repetitive. Every encounter was just me or other men killing hoards and hoards of solider's again and again and again which did happen in the original but far less frequently to this.  3) Some very important and interesting dialogue told while your in game on the battlefield, making it quite hard sometimes to focus on two things at the same time.  Now on why it is a better sequel: 1) Clearly better and more memorable soundracks  2) More interesting villains 3) More twists I do like just how bombastic and in your face it is with its story and the twist with shepherd was alright but I wouldn't say its campaign earns it legendary status like its multiplayer does and with how repetitive the game play loop was for me I can't rate it any higher the the original. So I'll give it an 8/10. I completed the campaign in just about 5 hours on the dot which is roughly the same as original so I would advice you to get this game cheap as well if you aren't into the multiplayer. Also shepherd I felt also had an anticlimactic ending just like Zakhaev's which kinda disappointed me also but since they don't really focus on the campaign on these types of games to begin with, I guess I can't really expect well flushed characters to begin with. I call them surface level villains. They have also seemed to have fixed all my minor gripes in the original which were quite problematic which I guess is a bonus.

{"text": "This is merely a personal opinion, my first game of morrillo was this so my opinion will be positive. If you do not want to read everything, I will only tell you that just as people are fans of some saga and their game can be catastrophic they love it for example anime or sports video games or the repetitive series of some COD for someone who enjoys them it will be something Okay. I am currently about to conclude it in Nightmare, and only missing 3 achievements I can say that the game seemed very good, not excellent or a masterpiece, its visual section is excellent and it compensates a little perhaps for the fact of some defect in the control or the hassle of doing SPEEDRUN like crazy to get S ranks to get money to add some weapon upgrade or upgrade to the character. It's kind of sad to know that in 2 hours you can finish a game yes. But it does not mean that the fact of exploring wanting to see those Easter eggs squeeze out everything like getting the Merits (trophies or achievements in the game) is to play it over and over again, it is true that even then it would not compensate perhaps 20 hours of play, but not We can put against that fight against Nemesis those crazy chases or trying to avoid the punches, that sensation of adrenaline that the good STARS generates you Seeing them again in a different way is good, it is amazing to see that the industry is committed to remastering, that for some they should have a 70-hour campaign but that with those 5 hours that I just finished it, they made me happy again and again to want to get it out. all the necessary profit.

{"text": "In today's seemingly distant two thousand and eleventh year, the little-known studio Zachtronics Industries released the game SpaceChem, which can literally be translated as Space Chemistry. What happens infrequently, the name completely conveys the essence: we have to do chemistry in space (not in the open, of course, but not on Earth) as a young engineer, namely, to program processes in molecular reactors, and sometimes even build small production complexes . I think, already at this moment it becomes clear that SpaceChem is not an action, not a quest or even a graphic novel, SpaceChem is a very harsh and hardcore puzzle, but first things first. Let's start with the plot. He is, and meets us with the phrase \"You know, people die in space\", which sets the general tone for the whole story. The plot here is essentially a medium-sized short story that connects levels and reveals a classic parable about the menacing majesty of the unknown and the fragility of the person who encounters this unknown. Pretty pleasant reading, framed by small sketches. But the salt of the game is far from history. It's time to talk about the gameplay itself. Most of the time, the player watches a ten-by-eight board. On this board, he programs two lines - red and blue. When the reactor starts, manipulators start running along the lines, which, when passing through the cells marked by the player, perform various actions - they capture and throw, connect, rotate molecules of various substances (new teams appear later). The goal is to obtain molecules of other substances from the molecules of some substances that appear in the left half of the reactor through transfers and transformations, and then send them to the right half. And you need to program the reaction scheme so that it runs for several tens of cycles. It seems to me that it is rather difficult to describe game mechanics clearly, or I just can't do this, so I'll give a small analogy. The gameplay of SpaceChem is like solving a problem in a technical subject: computer science, physics, geometry, and the like. There is a clearly stated condition. There is a certain device that allows you to perform various operations. And most importantly, there is room for creativity. The gameplay of most games of this genre is to find the answer conceived by the authors. Here, there is no clear-cut framework for how to solve the proposed problem. Most of the SpaceChem levels can be completed in dozens, if not hundreds of different ways, and the emotions from the next successfully completed reaction are the same as from finding a solution to the very system of diffours that has been haunting for a couple of days. The emphasized cold and minimalistic design just creates the feeling that I'm sorry, you didn't come here to be entertained, but to engage in a business that requires a serious approach and concentration. In the stages with the construction of chemical plants, the game becomes even more complicated, forcing you to think in a slightly different plane and decide for yourself which molecules and in what order to load into the reactors, laying piping systems and choosing where to place the reactors. It is impossible not to mention the complexity. With a sufficiently high entry threshold, SpaceChem does not slow down throughout its entire length and constantly throws up increasingly complex and more non-trivial tasks, and at the end brazenly selects nights spent trying to at least find the right course of the reaction. A sort of Dark Souls puzzle world. In conclusion, I note that everyone who wants to stretch their brains loves games of this genre, interesting tasks and severe challenges, SpaceChem is simply recommended, unless of course you have heard of it before. The rest, I believe, does not make much sense to get acquainted with this game, and the plot can be read on the Internet. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "At the time of writing this review, the game is still in Early Access. Zombie Party is a twin stick shooter in which you have to repel hordes of quite varied enemies, not just zombies as the title indicates. Mechanically the game is really competent, at first it can seem a bit overwhelming due to the amount of things that you have to pay attention to but as soon as you get used to the controls and the way the enemies move and attack the game becomes addictive. It is not simply dodging and shooting everything that moves, it is better to have a strategy and switch to the best weapon for each situation, managing the ammo is important so holding the trigger all the time is not the best idea. This way of playing is more evident in the Dungeon mode in which one has to kill the enemies of one level before moving on to the next and the levels are not simple arenas but more complex maps in which one can even find secret areas behind of destructible obstacles. The other modes are: Adventure: kill a certain number of waves of enemies followed by a boss and then go to a new level with another map and different enemies; Arcade - survive as long as possible and kill everything you can; Deathmatch: a vs mode in which you face other players, or bots. I could not test the local multiplayer mode, because for that you need other people :( As for the audiovisual part of the game it is\u2026 a bit difficult to process at times. The pixel-art is very well done and the visual effects are good , but more than once I found that everything was too bright or had too little contrast to understand what was going on. This ranges from not so important things like the text in some transitions is difficult to read because it is white on light colors at levels where some enemies can get lost in the background. The music is, as always, subjective to personal tastes (I liked it); although I can say that it goes according to the game: rather cheerful and energetic 8/10 ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": true}

{"text": "okay so i just got this game today and there are many pros and cons that i have run into when playing this game. first off i've only played though it once with ruby's character and a little bit with blake's i do have to say that the campaign was a little shorter than i had expected. i know that this is still in development and that the campaign is only a third or forth of the actual game, but with the knowledge that i've played through this once in 1.3 hours with only 1 partner to help out and you multiply that by the other 4 parts you're only getting a first playthrough of about 5.2 hours so this seems a little concerning with how short that seems to be. and i know it seems petty especially with the fact that you can play through 4 different times right now with all of team rwby and easily turn that to almost 21 hours. it still just seems a little short though i would recommend a single playthrough to be put to a least 6 to 7 hours. most of the gameplay was good and the leveling up system worked well but at the moment it still seems a little barebones on the leveling system and i feel like when i level up the new abilities or enhanced ones seem to not change too highly from the previous ones. the voice acting was great and the story kept me going for a bit and i am still invested into finding out what happens in the full game. the couple of bugs that i did find were minimal but bothered me just a bit. there was one when i would pick up a hidden piece and the enemies would stop for a few seconds and their life bars would dissappear so i couldn't kill them in this time. the other one was when i would jump over enemies and my character would freeze up and not move until a used a special move or attacked a few times in a row. the graphics and stylized rwby series animation when perfect in this game and neither of them dropped in quality or caused my game to drop in framerate on ultra settings. oh and one last small thing when you get knocked down i think the timer should be shortened from 45 seconds to 30 seconds since a lot of the time my teammates where stuck fighting and it became tedious to wait for that long. so just to recap: pros: -great characters -great settings -amazing sound quality -great gameplay -amazing graphics -investing story -i love the rwby show and game now a lot so this game gets an A cons: -minor bugs -gameplay is a bit short -not a lot of characters -barebones upgrade system -long death timer reccomendations: -lengthen the story a bit -add more leveling to the upgrade system that feels like there are actual changes going on -add a bigger cast of characters (probably teams JNPR, CFVY, and the headmasters ozpin, glinda, qrow, and ironwood) -shorten the timer to 30 seconds -and this one was a bit on the side but a customization system could work well as well. almost all of the maion characters have had at least one or 2 suit changes so that could be something to probably make worth of the hidden pieces. if to find so many as one character you get a new outfit as well. just rolling off of my head here. all in all i like this game and i see a lot of potential for the future. i give it an 8/10. happy game making!!!!!!

If in the last part we wandered only in the psychiatric hospital on the island, then in this one the city is open to us. When it comes to Harley Quinn's Revenge, we all remember how the main game ended. The Joker is dead, and his main fan, Harley Quinn, cannot bear the loss. She wants revenge on the batman. She manages to kidnap him and take him prisoner. In this add-on, we first play for Robin, free the batman and play for the batman. The goal is to neutralize, capture and put the main criminal, that is, Harley Quinn, in a mental hospital. On the way, breaking a bunch of noses, jaws and limbs of Harley's assorted henchmen. The game, as always, is divided into the search for evidence, fights with a bunch of bandits and the quiet neutralization of armed opponents. Overall a good addition to the main game.

{"text": "I've been trying games of this sort for a few days now and I have to say that 'Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan' is my favorite so far. One of the games I have tried is GL: The Forsaken Bride but I really liked this one better, everything from the soundtrack (which is amazing), storyline, characters was very well thought out. In GL2: Song of the Dark Swan, you are a healer summoned by the king to check on the health condition of his queen. Without giving it away, let's just say that you end up getting more than what you signed up for ehehe. The story is interesting, much more than the Forsaken Bride, more so, that at some point you even feel sorry for what is happening to some of the characters and that is something that I didn't feel while playing FBride. The minigames/puzzles are quite similar to the one's on FBride so you won't feel much difficulty there if you managed to do them on the previous game. However, If my memory serves me, I think there are a few that are a bit different but still doable. As I mentioned before the soundtrack is beautiful, it gives a special touch to the story and makes it even more amazing and captivating. The artwork is fantastic, the characters are wonderfuly presented with nice details.  Oh and lets not forget the little helpers! On the Dark Swan they are super cute and, of course, you'll get more than one. For those of you who don't know, on Grim Legends games you usually have little guys that help you advance in the story (don't worry they don't work as hints or cheats, etc). The only thing that I liked a bit more on the Forsaken Bride than on Dark Swan was the Bonus Content. I felt that on FB it worked better as a continuance of the main story and I didn't felt that with the DS bonus content. If you like games like this then I suggest buying it, being it in a bundle, on sales or at regular price, it's well worth the purchase :) ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}
{"text": "Since buying, I have played a total of 20 hours, and I have seen one large, promising update during that time.  If you are not familiar with crafting mechanics, this game may at first pose some problems for you, but it is, for the most part, a fairly forgiving and enjoyable experience even on Normal mode, and I can see it developing into something bigger and better as time goes on.  The latter statement I believe more wholeheartedly because the developers seem dedicated to listening to their players, and passionate about improving the game at a reasonable pace.  With any luck, and some hard work, they'll see Raft become an iconic staple in ocean survival games.   The bottom line is that fans of the survival genre will be delightfully surprised by the game's humble, simple premise.  You start on a raft made up of four wooden squares, given only a plastic hook on a rope, and your character's health, hunger and thirst to look out for.  Fortunately, the tides and the wind bring your raft past floating materials such as wood, plastic and leaves, and the ocean is abundant with fish and seagulls for the initiated hunter.  Such ingredients can be collected in between your journeys from island to island, and fashioned into parts for the raft, or tools for your character.   After a few hours, your raft may resemble something more akin to a ship, and eventually a floating home, with all (most) of the amenities of land.  It may even feel.. cozy, at some point. Everything in between those stages is up to you, and that freedom definitely makes Raft replayable as hell, even in its current stage.

{"text": "SNK can be said to be a piece of self-releasing work in various senses. It is a combination of sex transfer Terry, women's Iori, and a bunch of pro-daughters. To tell you clearly, this is a fan-oriented work. The threshold is extremely low, innovative fighting mechanism, and various props. Of course, the most important thing is that there are waifu, and it will be very fun to play with your friends. The system of this game is relatively simple. Although it is shallower and less competitive than the classic fighting system, the innovative part of the system is still very interesting and entertaining (see all kinds of spoofs in the game, props, Obviously, this work is for entertainment). The entertaining positioning also means that the threshold of this game is not high. The game cancels the upper, middle and lower attacks, no squatting posture, and the defense is button defense. The ordinary actions of a character only have three kinds of light and heavy casting, and each action has a button. The special actions are kills, super kills and substitutions. There are also three buttons, all of which are one-click moves. Even a novice who has not been exposed to fighting games can play cool combos with a little practice. . The innovation of the game is that the resource energy in the game and HP share an upper limit, and all nirvana releases need to consume energy to release, HP will not be judged in the end, and the game must require super nirvana to end the opponent. , This leads to the importance of resource management in the game, otherwise it will often be found that the opponent is out of blood, and there is no resource to overtake the situation. This mechanism is still a bit interesting, but unfortunately this game is just a tad stop, and there is no in-depth development of the gameplay. Fighters should know that the most uncomfortable thing about the King of Fighters 14 is that it is three years behind the industry's picture level. Therefore, the game is from the same clan and the same source. If you are looking at the picture, players should not expect too much. The original picture can be blown up, but change If you become a 3D model, your interest will plummet, and you can barely accept it by relying on love to beautify in your brain (probably), but it is slightly better than the King of Fighters 14. Therefore, although the game has a dressing system, the player may not have it at all. If you are interested in playing and fighting warmly, it is better to find a professional clothing manufacturer. In addition, it may be due to the SNK heroine fighting, the whole game is too girlish, all kinds of attacks will be accompanied by star special effects like kirakira, the main male players like it or not, mainly because there are too many special effects, making the screen too messy Now, it has reached the point where it affects the visual experience. I hope you will pay attention to it. Matching with the picture, although the music is also in the style of the girl Mary Su, it is really good to listen to. The game itself has only 14 playable characters. It is a bit shabby for SNk. There are too few characters. It is easy to see that the model resources are the materials of the King of Fighters 14 directly. This also shows that SNK is really out of money. KOF15, Samurai Samurai is still understandable. In other respects, to be honest, there are relatively few gameplay in the game, only story mode, computer battle, survival mode and online battle. The story of the game can only be said to come up with a headshot. All the female characters team up and are trapped in the castle by a sand metamorphosis to play \"Chicken Eating\". There is nothing in the plot that can be studied or impressive. The only interesting thing is to pass the level. After the stalk hidden in the dialogue between different characters, Ending, players who understand will smile when they see it. A big problem with the story mode is that the AI \u200b\u200bdifficulty setting is not reasonable. Before the BOSS, all opponents are wooden stakes, but when they reach the Boss level, they are suddenly promoted to a 100% confirmed master, which makes the player very uncomfortable. The game does add the standard gameplay of fighting games: computer battle and survival mode, but there is no arcade mode, which is a pity (cut corners). For online battles, you comrades basically don't need to think about it. If there is no one on the ghost server, if there are no offline conditions, I think PVP can only be played online. Since there is no small partner in the online situation, it cannot be tested. Although there are various problems, old players of the King of Fighters can still try. After all, SNK has been very unsatisfactory over the years, so you should support SNK. Fortunately, SNK slowed down. Seeing Samurai Samurai in Unreal 4, my worries about the King of Fighters 15 can be put down anyway. Even if you don\u2019t catch a cold for this, everyone can still pay attention to the wave of Samurai Hyuno that will be released on June 27 (ps4). For many years of new work, the current quality of news can still be guaranteed. Please pay attention to more game recommendations ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Think Vaka Game Magazine (hereafter referred to as VGM) should be considered a newcomer publisher just a year ago. I never thought that it is now the leader of the famous story adventure game in the industry. No, the popularity of \"Battered Noelle\" and \"Angel of Killing\" has not passed yet, and VGM has quickly opened a new pit \"Arnie Incident Book\". It has to be said that VGM has found its own way of survival in a large number of two-dimensional games today. Although the game has injected a lot of suspense, puzzle solving, adventure, fantasy, and puzzle solving elements, it is essentially selling The character and plot, coupled with the agency's long-term capture of details such as pictures, sound effects, and easter eggs, have resulted in a self-contained style. It feels like playing, which not only satisfies the curiosity of many players to understand the puzzle, but on the other hand, the puzzle itself is not difficult, which reduces the player's frustration and brain burn. It is stressful in everyone's life and work. Today, it is really a very pleasing setting. When VGM was preparing for the release of ``Arnie Event Book'', it can be said to be very playful and attracting attention. As early as in major publicity platforms and forums, a large number of serial four-frame comics written by Mr. Harutaro were released. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, I suggest you go find it and take a look before you play. It\u2019s pretty careful and contains a lot of content. Most of the plots are funny and cute, and various funny little clips show up. From this point of view, this work is already slightly better in the publicity stage. In addition, new improvements in reasoning have been publicized, and a large number of \"intrinsic reasoning\" has been adopted, which can help the studio broaden the fan circle. Japanese benign reasoning is really good, but it has been slightly lacking in recent years. Like the Detective Conan series, there are more and more suspicions of modular and routine operation, while the Jintian series are relatively lacking in domestic introduction and some animations have made this work. If you can inject a fresh blood of inferential reasoning, it's hello and me, everyone is happy... But the result... VGM, you should honestly sell the character and plot, don't talk about the original reasoning, otherwise The planning is really likely to be knocked by fans. As for the suppression of the coffin board of Mr. Edogawa Ranbu... Your follow-up works can do well, and we fans will do more. In short, really don't treat \"The Arnie Event Book\" as a basic reasoning, or even treat it as a rigorous reasoning work. If the player is looking at the character and the plot, then I can tell you that the performance of this work is particularly good, not only the protagonists, Arnie Nittat and Lin Rheinweiss, but also the impressive characters. The supporting roles are also distinctive and lovable. Not to mention many details of the story and the process. The atmosphere is very well created. Although there are not so many tragic and joyous in the end, the various ups and downs in the process still make the players addicted. Just play a serious adventure game. The plot background of this work starts with the hostess Lin. On the one hand, she has just worshipped and played with her mother's grave, but on the other hand, her father still does not recognize the death of her mother; on the other hand, the maid in the family talks about the manor Many men went out at night to be murdered bizarrely, but the housekeeper interrupted the maid. The frustrated and perplexed Lin returned to her room and looked at a record of the Vampire King like a little girl who chased the stars. And when she really met her idol Arnie later, an adventure that was somewhat horrified, but actually better than the story began. The picture in this work well inherits the style of the agency, which is very similar to the handwritten two-dimensional painting, and the Chinese translation part has been further improved compared with the previous two works, making the entire game in the hands of Chinese players. Got to put it down even more. Moreover, there are many elements in the game, such as escape and limited-time dialogue, which also adjusts the rhythm of the game to a certain extent, giving players more sensory stimulation; hamster party players will also find many collections that are not related to the main line in the process. It can be said that multiple levels meet the needs of players. In general, although this game has failed its own propaganda in reasoning, but apart from the reasoning part, when it comes to the performance of all aspects of the game, it is actually very remarkable. As a two-dimensional adventure game, it is actually still a very exciting high-score masterpiece. It is highly recommended for the plot party and human-based party player experience.

{"text": "Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop (ASRD) is a top-down team-co-op shooter. To me the game feels as if it's based off the movies: There is a mission to be executed, and your teams job is to get it done. Missions vary across a wide spectrum. I classify the game as an action/adventure/thriller/sci-fi with a dash of comedy (if playing with other qualified players). It's not scary like the alien movies don't worry. ASRD is a team-strategy game. Teams can be up to a size of 8, with 4 different classes. Tech, Officer, Medic, and Special Weapons. Each class has specializations, and each of the 8 marines has a unique skill load-out. All 8 marines have strengths and weaknesses that fit in with each of the other 7 marines in a very nice complementary way. This is not obvious when first playing the game. Unfortunately, new players do not mix well with seasoned veterans of the game, at all. The exceptions become loved players. Add the fact that there isn't a large pool of active players, noobs DO play on servers with veterans. So, because the game has a noticeable learning curve, most people end up giving up and quitting the game. Ironically, one thing that makes the game very lovable is how much control it gives to the player in the game. There are numerous ways to do the same thing, allowing players to express their creative style in a remarkable way. Again, this is not obvious when first playing the game. There is no real story to the game, nor about the aliens. Most if not all maps have pda's lying around with emails, news, and stuff of the sort, but doesn't tie across from campaign to campaign. I personally like how they didn't add a story. It makes sense with the rest of the game. The controls are simple. Players can add buttons to do things to make the game more enjoyable and things more convenient, from binding keys to show you need health/ammo, to binding keys for quick restarts (asw_restart_mission). The fact that there isn't a real story is good because it allows the opportunity for it to be added in the future. Better no story and more of a focus on the game itself. In conclusion, the game is a 10/10. This isn't changed by the fact that there aren't a lot of players, because if you play the game, and ever need help with anything, there is always some sort of wiki or community discussion thread that elaborates on things beyond what you were looking for. There is a ridiculous contrast between the quality/content of the game, versus the player base. Highly recommended. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

The only I wish was an option was to turn off purchased researches like the gun variants or the ability to lower the chance of getting specific upgrade variants for guns similar to the supply hack because I'm not really a big fan of bullets being printed into a gun especially when ammo isn't a problem for me.

{"text": "Total War: Rome II - Caesar in Gaul DLC It goes without saying that you like history if you're playing a Total war game. But if you're particularly intrigued by Roman history, the Caesar in Gaul DLC concentrates on a very specific period of time, 58-51 BC. You can command hordes of barbarians to bring the Roman Empire to its knees, or conquer the savages yourself for Rome's glory. There's also some nordic factions to play as if you desire a different approach. The map is zoomed in to Western Europe, including all of Germany, France, England, Italy and Scandinavia, so it has a tight focus. Each turn is two weeks, to account for the short time span of the DLC. + There are different buildings and units for each faction in this DLC which is nice. Weather now plays a crucial role in combat, with freezing conditions causing the deaths of thousands during winter months if they are sieging or traversing the wilderness. Dry summers can affect food production negatively. In addition, there are minor changes to the map of Western Europe, with more regions and greater complexity. + Some changes have been made to how battle commanders function. In Caesar in Gaul, you control legendary leaders from history who will take up the mantle against your foes - Vercingetorix for Gaul or Julius Caesar for Rome, among others. Each have unique traits which impact their ability to influence soldiers and win engagements. - While Caesar in Gaul kept my attention and made some revitalising alterations, none of these should have been left out of the base game in the first place. Seasonal weather effects weren't included in Total War: Rome II (we had this in Total War: Shogun 2) so this is lazy game design. The commander modifications could and should have been part of the base game too. Most of the new features didn't take much effort for Creative Assembly to produce. Still, it's a good DLC and fun.

(27 Nov, 2017 @ 10:02am) The game looks like it was originally designed for single player. Playing the game with just keyboard and mouse may discourage a lot of people so it is recommended to use a controller. Solving the puzzles to advance into the game is fun. Playing local-coop adds more fun. However, because of the extra player, you'll be able to advance through a lot of puzzles without really solving them, it makes the game a lot easier because the stage is not adjusted for co-op. A lot of people may not like the game because of the controls, you have to control the left and right hand individually and the camera is tied to your movement; you'll be looking up to reach things and then be looking down while climbing. Some extras about the game are the easter eggs, some alternate/absurd ways to advance through the puzzles, and customizable look/color for the character. People with no local-coop partners requested for online multiplayer and the devs added it as a free update. This is why I had it voted for a steam award. The online multiplayer support for this game features 8 players and that breaks the default games stages. With this, I hope they add more stages designed for co-op. Workshop support would also help the game a lot so players can make their own stages and have it designed to be solved by 2, 3 or 4 players. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

Currently we have 4 character slots to swap in/out in the game, which caught my attention and at first seeing as this was unusual it is quite necessary as each wave adds higher difficulty to where teamwork coordination and knowledge of characters go into play. One complaint is there should be some type of kick/report feature in-game to remove \"trolls\" even though this has only happened once where a teamate would disregard us and let us win the stage for him.

{"text": "Darkarta is an interesting HOG, leaning on Indian-style mythology, which is a nice change of pace from most of the European-centric games that dominate this genre. Overall, it's an above-average game for the genre, but still features a few flaws. The good:   - while they are of the style we've come to expect from the hidden object genre of games, I find the graphics in Darkarta to be more interesting than average with great use of lighting and color. The cut-scene animations are also very strong, and much more fluid than most other HOGs.  - you will get your money's worth from this game...there is a ton of content, and playtime is 1.5X-2X what you get from your average HOG  - for the most part, they are beautifully rendered and more interesting than many puzzles in this genre with a couple of exceptions (a notable one named in the \"bad\" section).  - excellent throughout The bad:  - Now, I actually think the issue is more the latter than the former. The voice actors were doing what they were asked to do with the script they had. But holy stay-at-home-mom-with-no-romance-in-her-life, Batman! There is SO much melodrama every time the protagonist goes to talk about her little girl that she's trying to rescue that you'll wish that you were playing on mute by the time you get halfway through the story. The dialog is just a schlocky, gooey, godawful \"I will do anything to save you, sweetie\" gag-fest all around. You love your kid. We get it. Stop barking about it non-stop and get to saving her, lady.  - I found a couple, but the most obvious was the puzzle where you have to create patterns under water in the pool...nothing would trigger the check for the puzzle being solved unless you stayed under water until you ran out of oxygen. Then, it would trigger the check and move on. These are things that should be caught during play-testing.  - there are a couple of places where you go to inspect an area and a detail graphic pops up. However, you're actually expected to look through several scenes in this pop-up...but the only indicator are arrows at the edges and they're not particularly obvious. I spent a lot of time wandering around, trying to figure out how to trigger any kind of further event before I realized that there was more content in these. Given that there are achievements for completing the game within a time limit, this sort of thing is frustrating. Make the navigation more obvious and intuitive.  - Seriously, the protagonist falls through a floor or a bridge or off a cliff at least four times, maybe five, and all of them appear to be 25 feet (8 meters) or more...and there's never any kind of serious injury. Any one of these falls could kill a person, but would likely at least injure them pretty severely. But nope, not here. The protagonist just shakes it off and gets on with things like this is a normal occurrence (well, in the case of this game, I guess that it is :D). It's time to think of some other non-returnable transitions to the next area without yet another completely unrealistic fall. I don't expect too much realism in HOGs, but this was getting hilarious by the third time or so.  - THESE ARE THE WORST PUZZLES IN HISTORY. NO ONE LIKES THEM. STOP PUTTING THEM IN THESE GAMES. Really, this is always just an indication of \"we ran out of puzzle ideas, but needed one more, so let's throw in a sliding puzzle.\" It's lazy and irritating, and if there wasn't an achievement for not skipping any puzzles, I would skip this thing the second that button lit up. Blech. So, that may seem like a lot of bad and not so much good, but that's not true. All of the bad things were (mostly) specific moments in the game, and the good things were pretty consistent throughout the game. If you play a lot of HOGs, you could definitely do a lot worse than Darkarta, and chances are that you'll really enjoy your time in the game. There is an impressive amount of attention to detail in the graphics, and that alone kept me wondering what the upcoming crazy scene would look like and to where I would travel next. That makes Darkarta a solid HOG - thumbs-up from me. ______________ Note for achievement hunters: this game will most likely require two run-throughs if you want to 100% it. I find that irritating with HOGs because I don't feel the need to replay them once I've solved them. But, you'll probably need a slower run-through, paying close attention to find all of the morphing objects, solving the puzzles the first time, etc. Then, you'll need to do a speed run after that, skipping animations and puzzles, so that you can solve the main game under a time limit. It's an unusual achievement set-up for these kind of games, so I wanted to point that out for people like me that enjoy getting 100% of the achievements on any game where it doesn't mean 500 hours of time investment. :) ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

A completely new kind of killer, where you won't necessarily get any further with conventional methods. I don't think the sister is overly strong. However, it's pretty deadly in the right hands. I would put them on a par with the hillbilly (backwoods). But since their abilities work completely differently than those of the conventional killers, it is almost in a class of its own. It is even more difficult to play than the already difficult Hill Billy. You always have to keep in mind that the game is still being developed. Nothing is set in stone. Maybe a few more adjustments will follow. Unfortunately, I wasn't allowed to play the new map yet, but I'm looking forward to it. Unfortunately, and that's really not nice, there are still some persistent bugs. Like that you often have to try to join a lobby x times before it works. And sometimes bugs that affect the game for both killers and survivors. I would like to see more work on fixing than on further development. Even if I and many others are sure to be very happy about new content. The decision to make it possible for all players to see strange killers and survivors and maps in action even if you don't buy the DLC (if it shouldn't be free in the future) is right and good. The main game didn't cost the world, but I hope that the main game should be more or less finished at some point. The DLC's are reasonable in price.

{"text": "LIMBO meaning: edge, edge, indecision, uncertainty, uncertainty. In Catholicism, a place separate from heaven and hell, according to ancient Catholic doctrine, it was the place where the souls of children who died without baptism went and their souls would go to limbo, because they did not have the baptismal grace to go to heaven, but they had no personal sin to go to hell, the game itself has no plot or story, not even the characters have names. Just by understanding the concept and meaning of the word Limbo, it already gives you a feeling that you already know the game completely, lacking only a few more details, such as the fact that there are other children who kill it if you have the chance and strange creatures like spiders and flies (bigger than the kid), as well as the scenery changing very quickly, through forests, factories and hotels. My point of view of the game: Apparently Limbo for not having a story done, leaves a blank sheet for you to even imagine what is going on in the game, in the game the anonymous boy died by an accident on a ladder of a tree house (you you can see it in the game menu) the ladder is broken and there are 2 small swarms of flies on the floor, which may indicate that there are two bodies there, the boy's and the girl's, but we cannot reach that conclusion, because we don't know if the girl is really dead, since in the game itself, her eyes don't shine like the boy's and now you tell me \"there are other kids in limbo and their eyes don't shine\", You heard the saying that eyes are the windows of the soul? Probably yes. So this does not indicate that the people who are there with him have a soul or just that they are there to prevent you from completing your journey (In the game in question the boy lives a cycle of a journey that never ends) he starts the game and has a objective that we know is to find the girl, at the foot of the tree where he died. And when he reaches that goal he just starts all over again as if it were the first time trying. It's just you to unleash your creativity and try to understand the game's environment, it's fun because it looks like you made the game's story, and it really is, you do it and you share it, as I'm doing! The game already gives you that option because it doesn't have a clear history. That's it, this is my point of view on Limbo and I hope you like it and I recommend this game a lot to those who haven't played, it is worth every second in it.

The outstanding level of detail that's been put in the environments, physics, sound design and soundtrack, NPC and character interactions is what truly makes this game unique.

(skip this if you're not interested in such) As you might have noticed I've praised the game a lot and that may raise a flag. I'm not a big fan of 2D walking simulators/platformers. This game took me by surprise and I forgot that it was such a game mechanically. The atmosphere of the game and the level of detail put by the developers are outstanding. On numerous ocassions I tried stuff just to test the developers only to be surprised by the fact that they've thought about this too! Some character interactions were surprisingly satisfying. From an audiophile perspective the sound design and execution were out of this world. There was a sequence where soundtrack, sounds and gameplay blended in one perfect moment that's still with me. Brilliant. At some point I was so immersed in the game world that certain sequences/environment made me gasp for a few seconds while I was processing what was happening.

{"text": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution itself is an extremely large-scale game, which I will not be able to talk about in detail in a short review. The Deus Ex series itself did not attract me at all, but somehow in the summer, when I saw that Human Revolution was being sold for 59 rubles, I had a sharp desire (and when I went through \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to grab this creation. everything turned out to be amazing and at the same time I didn\u2019t get bored. True, sometimes the game was so difficult and demanding on my skills that I was scared to go into it. The main character is Adam Jensen (his name was like that), a former special forces soldier, and at the moment games, the security agent of the company he works for (it may sound strange, but how much time has passed since my passing). And one fine afternoon, the company building, in which Jensen was, is attacked. Who committed the attack. That's the plot! And now briefly about the main thing! Plot-9 of 10. Although it seemed a little confusing and drawn-out, it is still interesting, with twists of events and other things that are typical for modern games. -12 out of 10. I used to think that the most non-linear stealth action is Dishonored, but after passing it I realized that I was a moron, and that my friends were right. Deus Ex: Human Revolution cards, like anthills and labyrinths, keep secrets. The number of paths will double when pumping special skills (of which there are many). Music and World-10 out of 10. For lovers of the future, cyberpunk and other garbage, it is strictly advised to play this creation. The world is not only made interesting and stylish, but is complemented by atmospheric music. The final score is 9 out of 10. Despite such advantages, Deus Ex: Human Revolution still has disadvantages that spoil the impression of passing. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "This is my first review that was written in serious cabbage soup, so do not judge strictly) I bought the game quite spontaneously, just by surprising it at a sale. I've heard a lot of things about the game: online question, entry threshold, etc. 1. Online. In the game, it keeps on a figure of about 8-10 thousand. This is completely enough to find almost any modes within 30 seconds. 2. Entry threshold. The threshold is quite high, at first it will seem to you that this is an ordinary casual shooter, but after playing for a while you will start to come across this game, these are fans who have been playing for more than the first or second year who just fly around the map and endure everything that is possible, like that what you decide is getting better or just leaving online. First of all, this is a \"Multiplayer arena-shooter\", but the game has a well-made campaign, you can't say that it was made just like that, but it does not pull 10/10 either. The company is interesting, but short, touching, but too simple. That's why many people buy this game, in Titanfall 2 there is a completely different game mechanics compared to any shooter. Sicked players who simply annihilate the entire map at first just seem to be the Gods of this game, but after playing 15 hours, I began to less understand the mechanics of the game and learn parkour. The Titans themselves deserve special attention, they are not imbalanced, but rather dilute, and so is a very dynamic gameplay. The game costs adequate money by today's standards, online on a PC is enough to search for ice rinks in 30-40 seconds, the entry threshold is high, but you don't need to be an esports player either. I give the game a score of 9/10. And is Titanfall 2 worth buying in 2020? Yes, it's worth it. P.S. \"As great a shooter as it is underrated.\" ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

You have to call poor people with one coin to your kingdom and give them work, give bows for guards and hunting, hammers for building gardens, towers and walls, and scythes for gold mining. What? Oblique to mine gold? How? It's easy in Kingdom, you give a person a scythe and send him to the garden and he plants gold instead of food, an extremely useful and profitable profession. You will have to defend yourself from the monsters that crawl out of the portals, these portals can be destroyed, but for this you need to create a detachment to attack. To do this, you need to pump the castle for the maximum level and hire a knight, he can lead a detachment of handbrakes and go into battle. Enemies: there are little monsters whose main thing is to steal gold, they do not kill people, but rob and make beggars out of them, a beggar loses his profession and goes into the forest, but he can be returned with one coin. There are also flying monsters that no longer rob but devour people with ends, towers must be installed against them. There are also large monsters that easily destroy fortified walls and spawn small monsters. There are also statues on the island which, if given money, will improve you, a statue of archers will improve archers and a statue of workers will improve walls. Bonus: on the island somewhere in the forest there is a horse that you can change to, it is faster than yours. I hope you enjoyed the review. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

Like a dating simulator in which you just need to meet and get to know your hypostases. Pickup teacher so to speak. But this is not so, or rather not quite so. And yet, what could be wrong that two young men meet in the park ?! So, a certain young man named Lou, an Englishman and badly balakin 'in Portuguese, met a girl in a bar, after a couple of bubbles the hunt was strong, he decided to pour out his soul in front of her, the lad liked the guy, and to cement their still green relationship, she gives Lou a date in the park, promising to wait by the pond. Filled with curiosity and driven by the idea and finally to interrupt a series of unsuccessful acquaintances, our elated guy comes the next day to the same place. Upset that no one was there, he decided to explore this rather large park, and this is where this everyday and strange story begins. As I wrote above, this is a simple quest, point and point. We control our boy, examine objects, interact with them. There are no riddles, there are no puzzles with rebuses, everything is simple, you have to think intuitively how to get this or that thing, how to act in a simple situation, read a letter and so on. The picture is just digitized photographs, highly pixelated, which are static, although a little animation and pleasant sounds of nature have been added. Characters too, photos of people frame-by-frame transferred into the game, looks rude, sharp animation of movement not everyone will like. The dialogues, although rather monologues, are interesting. Each subject can be viewed and thought on this score, I personally like these little things. Not protracted, meditative and soothing, except for the sharp movements of Messrs. There is no music, just birds and titmouses are singing, but the breeze rustles the foliage, babble and serenity. In short, I recommend the game. She will show what is \"All ingenious is simple\" and \"What happens when nothing happens\" When triviality can present a strange and even unpleasant surprise with an unexpected twist.

{"text": "Wu Lin Zhi is an RPG game with martial arts as the theme, developed by Jianghu Studio using the 3D engine Flexi self-developed by Snail, and published by Snail Company. Wu Lin Zhi adopts an open world mode, players can freely carry out main and side missions, and there are more than 20 martial arts for players to choose which one to join, players can also choose to join the court to fight against martial arts people, the story is quite diverse. The decisions made by the players in the game and the task direction chosen will affect the direction of the ending. There are currently nearly 60 endings in the game for players to explore. The game combat system adopts a turn-based mode. The fighting system is very simple and easy to use. It consists of attack, defense and auxiliary skills, suitable for casual players. Wulin Chi has some of the characteristics of the online game \"Nine Yin Zhenjing\". Players who have played this online game will also like Wulin Chi. The game is valuable and memory invaluable. +The game supports 21:9 display, the picture is not cut or stretched+RPG rich elements in the game+High degree of freedom of the game+The game fighting system is simple, suitable for casual players+The game quality is not bad (with full special effects) +Game soundtrack Not bad + the game comes with Simplified Chinese + the game supports automatic save, manual save and read files at any time-the game cannot modify the resolution, cannot window the game-the game does not support exclusive full-screen games, is not friendly to G-Sync support-the game does not support handles -The game does not support custom buttons-The game cannot adjust the camera rotation speed-The game requires a high computer configuration, and the optimization of multi-core processing is poor-The frequency of game reading is high, which seriously affects the fluency of the game-There is a chance that the game will get stuck during the reading process Machine and crash, especially when the game is opened, it is particularly easy to crash-the game lacks novice tutorials and task guidance-the game does not have steam achievements, does not support cloud archives, and does not have a card system. Wu Lin Zhi is a domestic martial arts game, foreign It is difficult to find RPG games based on martial arts in the game, so Wu Linzhi made me look forward to the game and want to experience this game. Although the game is good overall, the game is really bad in terms of optimization. It takes a long time, often crashes and freezes for no reason, and needs to restart the computer every time, which is very unpleasant during the experience. Although the game supports 21:9 resolution, the game cannot set the resolution by itself. The game will force the full-screen game according to the resolution of the player\u2019s display, and the game cannot be windowed. I have tried the window mode in the game settings, but every time This setting will inevitably cause the system to crash. You must forcibly press the power button to restart the computer, which is a very serious BUG. The full-screen mode in the game is not an exclusive full-screen mode, so players who use G-Sync and multi-screen displays will experience more obvious pauses, and there is no vertical synchronization option in the game. The frequency of reading the game is very high. It takes a certain amount of time to read the disk every time you switch scenes. What is more unacceptable is that you need to read the disk in every lesson. The game progress is quite uneven, so I try to avoid fighting in the big map. Because it is disgusting to wait and read the disk repeatedly. Although the image quality options in the game are abundant, the more basic options mentioned above are absent, which will make players feel that the development team is not careful enough, the camera rotation speed in the game cannot be adjusted, and the keyboard does not support custom keys. The game's combat system is turn-based, and the operation is relatively simple. You only need to be familiar with the combat options of offensive moves, frame moves and air moves. These 3 commands are actually very easy to understand. Players can regard them as rock, paper, scissors, and 3 Commands are all related to each other, but the enemy chooses to defend when attacking, and the enemy can choose to heal. The attacking moves of the game are mainly based on the martial arts moves learned by the player, and the moves can increase their power through skill points. The martial arts moves are mainly divided into 4 categories, namely knives, swords, fists and long handles. I personally recommend choosing a focused practice. If the two minds are divided and invested, it will lead to insufficient damage. Defensive martial arts is relatively simple, there are not too many classifications, basically choose the exercise with high defensive value. Internal strength corresponds to auxiliary martial arts, most of which are based on healing and passive skills. Doing more branches can easily obtain a variety of martial arts cheats. In addition, there are action points, action bars, vigor blood value and internal strength value that need to be paid attention to when fighting. The action points directly determine the upper limit of the character's actions. Each trick has action points that need to be consumed. As long as the action points are still positive, the player can set multiple moves in a round, and the action bar determines the character's action. The speed of the move, the character can move when the action bar is full. The so-called world martial arts is fast and unbreakable, and the priority of moves can always take advantage. The snow value is the player's health value, but when the vitality value is 0, the character will die, and each trick needs to consume internal force. Therefore, when the internal force value is insufficient, some tricks cannot be used. The player needs to properly arrange and calculate the order and all of the moves. The internal force value that needs to be consumed. In fighting, the enemy\u2019s next action intention sometimes appears on the enemy's head. As long as you use the countermeasures to accept the move, but when an enemy with unknown intentions appears, it is recommended to attack or defend as the main objective. Using auxiliary skills will often suffer. Although Wu Lin Zhi is an open world game, the design of the game is a bit boring. There is no clear guidance system for the tasks, and the main and branch lines are too similar. You will encounter a large number of NPCs in the city, and most of them are inconsequential information when you chat with each other. On the big map, you don't have NPCs. The mode of triggering the battle is similar to the classic RPG game. But every time it is triggered, the disk needs to be read, which really needs to be optimized. There are also collection and hunting systems in the game, which are added to the game in the form of a small game similar to Lianliankan. This is a good design for casual players, which can relax the game, but for players with expectations This seems insincere. The game's screen is acceptable, but it is not directly proportional to the configuration requirements. Domestic 3D games have a common problem, that is, the optimization is poor, and there is no exclusive driver optimization. It can only be optimized by the developer itself. Developers are allowed to spend their budgets on optimization. Players experience poor and manufacturers can\u2019t make money. Then the next step is worse. It is a vicious circle. Developers need to find a balance so that manufacturers can make money. Players will not be optimized. Problem and bad review of the game. As for the music, it's quite satisfactory. It didn't shine, but there was no obvious problem. The personal decision about the positioning of the game is not a large-scale game, it can only be regarded as a skit. If it is a casual game, I don\u2019t think it is true, because many of the systems in the game apply the gameplay of other games or long-term game methods. There is no place for innovation. If you want to operate it, you can only rely on the keyboard to move the character. It is obviously a turn-based game that can definitely be optimized to complete all operations with a mouse alone, but the manufacturer does not have that design, and the game does not support the handle, and the keyboard is hard for players. You can't play happily. In the current version, the personal recommendation is 5/10. If the optimization and flash card machine problems can be solved, the personal recommendation is 7/10. -Optimize the game configuration requirements, solve the problem of stuck machine and flashback-Optimize the frequency and speed of reading disks-Add options for adjusting resolution, vertical synchronization, windowing and exclusive full screen-Add options for adjusting lens movement speed-Add handle support -Add custom buttons-Optimize the guidance system for game tasks-Add steam cloud save, steam achievements and steam card system ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

The identity of a person can be identified by various methods such as the person's behavior, conversation, whereabouts, partner, clothes, erasure method, and intuition during the accident / incident scene. For some people, there aren't even clues to where the clues are, and there are many situations where you can rely solely on steady research or guessing that makes full use of the player's knowledge and intuition.

{"text": "is a free-to-play and easy-to-learn turn-based puzzle game with nice logic and quite a bit of variety to keep the mind entertained. The puzzles are split into different Chapters, each having a number of puzzles in the campaign. You can move from one level to the next after you have solved the last one. Pretty soon after starting, you will be gradually introduced to the different modifiers that are present in this game, and you will have to recognize what they do and learn in order to progress, especially in later-on-levels. Your goal is to get to the exit (green cube) before the enemies blocks catch up to you. They can catch you on the exit block after you final move, so you do not get a free turn, even at the end. The modifiers include stun trap (loss of turns), switches or plates on the floors that alter another part of the level (color designated), teleporters (to a specific tile), mines, bombs, etc. There are also character power ups that give you extra moves, cow your enemies, or provide a shield. The enemy types are ones that follow you, to ones that mirror you or do just the opposite, there are ones that pace back and forth and also ones that move twice as fast as you do. If you win, you can move on. If you lose, you can easily reset the level and try again. In the early stages, it was very easy, a few seconds per level and pretty soon you feel like there's no challenge at all. But after a while, I ended up having to reset some levels a bunch to figure out my path to victory. There are still plans to add more content to the game itself, so that's nice of the developers to do, especially since it's a free game to start. It's nice that they are going to keep supporting it and making it better for current and future players. There is a level editor in this game, and since everything is predictable, it will be fairly easy for the player base to start crafting their own levels. I am not sure if the functionality is there in-game to share and view community content, though. So hopefully that's something that can be added if it's not already there. Mouse clicks work fine, you can zoom in and out with the scroll wheel, but the sensitivity on the scroll seems too low. You can also use WASD or Arrow keys to move the character around. I don't like isometric view + UP/Down/Left/Right controls that move the character in a diagonal. So I used a mouse. Simple graphics, works well for this game. Look at some screenshots, what you see is what you get. Nothing fancy here. Most people who enjoy logic puzzles will likely have fun with this. If you don't like puzzles, you can still try it, it's free after all. Can't really beat that it's a free game, with an internal level editor and developer plans for additional content.  +It's completely free +Good logic +Predictable enemy block motions +Variety in enemy types, block modifiers, character modifiers to keep the player thinking +Developers pay attention to player input and will work on making the game better -  (I was wrong, developer corrected me.) -Currently no V-sync  offers some fun and small-scaled logic puzzles in a sequence that keeps the game refreshing with its gradual introduction of new elements.

The inclusion of a level editor is nice, now just need to make sure that the community can share custom content with each other.

Pros: Cool Items Magic works in a neat way Bosses are challenging and fun to farm Has Expert mode (Even more items) Has a modding Community thats alive and well Tons of replayability and different play styles Cons: Vanilla game once played alot can get stale Some bosses are OP Game is 32 bit. (Seriously devs add 64bit support please.) Game does not support IPV6 and as such can not host if you don't have dedicated IPV4. No Modding Support (Steam Workshop) Overall with all the stuff in this game, It surprises me how after 400+hours i can still find things i never knew existed. Plus with mods, It just adds even more content. If you get this, I highly suggest you play it through to completion at least once before going to get mods.

{"text": "Sevastopol? More like Disasterpol, amirite? If you haven't had enough of isolation and anxiety in 2020, here's a 20+ hour FPS campaign with natural stealth opportunities. I'm not a big fan of stealth games, I lack the patience, but here it really is in your best interest to avoid detection, so you don't actually mind all the crouching, sneaking, hiding and vent-crawling. I also opted not to kill any humans, cos the androids and the aliens didn't seem to need any help with that. If you already own Alien: Isolation and have failed to start it multiple times, which was my initial experience, be it for the scarce save options or general frustration, then please choose Novice as your difficulty level and strap yourself in. The game is intense enough as it is, cos each save point will be very very appreciated and the progress you make with each session will be satisfactory, because you survived. Alien: Isolation is not graphically demanding, not even 6 years ago imo, because it doesn't have to be. Its retro art design that aligns itself with the original film perfectly only calls for authenticity not realism. That's not to say the game lacks detail, on the contrary. Living quarters, machinery, clutter, all have impressive amount of detail to make it believable to this day. That extends to the superb lighting, sound effects that make you twitch in fear or paranoia and visual effects like smoke and mist that you can use to your advantage. It all creates a level of atmosphere not often seen. Changing batteries on your flashlight might not be everyone's cup of tea, but lighting is absolutely crucial here, as opposed to a game like Doom 3. Novice might be a bit too easy for some people, cos I found myself using the noisemakers most of the time, having all other items usually maxed out. The amount of lootable crafting components will surely come in handy in more demanding difficulty modes. Obviously there's the trope of not having any weapons midway through, but I'll give it a pass here, cos it adds to the suspense. There is no overall map for Sevastopol, the space station I mean not the annexed city on the Crimean Peninsula, only maps for each mission area. Backtracking on Sevastopol is almost counterintuitive, cos that's time spent away from the story, the tension and immediate danger, away from the furthest save station, so by the end of the game you're left with an ion torch and a fully upgraded security access tuner, but without the desire to find your way back to the starting areas. The game does throw you around already visited parts of Sevastopol multiple times, depending on the mission, but the further away you get from the next objective the more wrong it feels. It's a long game and thankfully the tension isn't maintained at a steady 11 throughout, so you get vacation time from the alien while you deal with more androids using the revolver, shotgun, bolt gun, molotovs or flamethrower, EMP mines or pipe bombs. Thankfully cutscenes are held to a minimum, but the story does have an uneven commitment between cutscenes, audio logs and email correspondence. You're basically too busy surviving so attaching yourself to another Sevastolink station is not always a good idea and it's not always easy to make out the audio logs or concentrate on reading its subtitles, cos the game doesn't stop for you to enjoy them in peace. Alien: Isolation would completely fall apart without its adaptive AI. Here's a villain or boss you're not meant to kill, but to run away from, scare away at the best of times. The more you attack it, the angrier it gets. Eventually it will start toying with you, cos it has learned your tactics and the flamethrower will not always have the desired effect. The fact that the most iconic horror movie monster has found its way to a licensed video game of actual quality and is used in a way that does the character justice is nothing short of a miracle, so respect to Creative Assembly to sticking to their vision, even though SEGA at that point wanted nothing to do with another Alien game.

{"text": "I am also no exception - this is my childhood game, one of the first. I didn\u2019t expect it to be on the incentive, I bought it and played it right away. This game would have remained forgotten if it were not for the music in the game (in my opinion). I believe that it was she who influenced my future tastes during the period of their formation (up to 15 years). As a result - now I listen to purely electronic and rarely rotsk. What an awesome muznya in this game, there is not a single \"faded, dull\" track, all perky and interesting. You can replay the game and listen to Mouzon - you won't get bored. The levels are also different - each is different from each other, except that the Fort and Camping are similar. Rival bots are just superb, not like in the same Need For Speed, where bots lag behind, not thinking to catch up (until you raise the level in the settings) - in this game they are actively trying to board you, knock you off the track. If you are so smart and will use slices, then it is better to cut while no one sees - they will repeat after you if they see. I also played in Re-volt, which is not in incentive, but I like this game more. It is brighter, juicier, the levels are more interesting and the cars are more credible. However, the revolt is also awesome in its own way, but not the essence. Result: 10/10 at the time of its release (2003 like?), 6/10 in 2017 ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Notice: The first level starts out very slowly, it very much introduces the exploration and puzzle aspect of the game, but also introduces a bit of combat, so don't quit too early! The game picks up to be super wicked after, and the story gets explored too, especially at Map 6! Onto the review!: As the first of my friends to have obtained this game, I have a long journey ahead of me with no hints, tips or tricks. This review is based solely on my own impressions and observations. Overall I'd give the game a solid 9/10 Gameplay is amazing, really a good portion of the old-school with a good mix of Dungeons & Dragons with health potions and other items.  Though sometimes the exploration and puzzles draw out a bit, but the soundtrack is amazing and the level design is beautiful, so the little backtracking there is, is almost enjoyable actually... Almost. That's the only downside I can find. Soundtrack is a blast, ranging from calm tunes to wicked metal to some synthwave-like serene moments etc. A rush and a blast and a bit of calm for the soul, I love it. (I later found out that Zan actually licensed one of the original composers who made tracks for the original Unreal Tournament!) Visuals are absolutely a blast for a DOOM Engine game (I forgot the name of the game engine, \"id tech 1\" or something I guess?) The environments are gorgeous and the secrets are classy in an almost cheesy \"The cupboards might reveal a stash if you spam \"interact\" on them all!\" kinda way. The game has an extra difficulty called \"Bearzerk\" which is absolutely amazing, it is a melee-only mode and has 5 different melee weapons so far, including throwables etc. All items/consumables are still available. I recommend giving it a try after you've beaten the game on one of the base difficulties first, though! EXTRA: Do look out for secrets! Map 7 has a Bag of Holding! To anyone who does not play D&D: Permanent ammo capacity upgrades, like the backpack in DOOM. 3 different nodes in Map 7 will lead to a single hidden note, which after reading, shows an X on your actual map for a location of it, you do need to get the shovel in the level first!

{"text": "When I heard about the release of this game, I had mixed feelings. Life is Strange made me fall in love with its originality, interesting plot and it seemed to me that nothing could be done better, as it usually happens. I've never been so wrong. Every moment creeps through to the very creeps, the musical accompaniment immerses you in the atmosphere of events with your head, helping to subtly feel all the emotions. During the game, you mentally replay the scenes from the first part and you stop believing that this is all - the beginning of the story of Life is Strange. And I want to note that its beginning hooked me much more than the story with the protagonist in the person of Max, who got confused in time and her abilities. We get to know the characters of the first part from the other side. We are experiencing the problems of the main character, from childhood trauma to adolescent maximalism. And a long-awaited acquaintance with the most important mystery of Life is Strange - everyone's beloved Rachel Amber. This was so lacking! But I would not have felt this \"boom\" of emotions without playing the first part. Perfectly. And it hurts too much. 9/10 - the last scene finishes it off.

The soundtrack, and sound effects are very effective. I love the pixelated graphics. It reminds me a little bit of Lone Survivor, another great horror game. The puzzles start simple. By part 3, I was taking notes, and drawing simple diagrams and maps. There were genuine moments of AHA! There are no guides covering all three parts so figuring out a puzzle really gave me a sense of accomplishment.  The scares. Everything from creepy atmosphere, to jump scares to NOPE! are in here. The game is great at making sure you are not comfortable for really any period of time. The only gripes is that there is a bit of backtracking and when you are stumped, you're running around thinking,\"WHAT AM I MISSING?\".

{"text": "Euro Truck Simulator 2 is an almost perfect trucker simulator. You start the game as an ordinary \"driver\" without your own truck and are engaged in transportation on various trucks of employers, naturally getting much less money than if you were engaged in transportation on your personal truck. Over time, you accumulate funds and buy your first truck; by the way, you can take out a bank loan for this business. The game provides a pretty decent tuning system: body, engine, chassis, transmission, cab, headlights, mirrors, handles, tires and even airbrushing (a separate set with the Scandinavian gods can be bought as DLC), it's nice that the tuning of the iron is not just for show \"it really affects the behavior of your truck on the road. Then you are engaged in the transportation of various goods, save up funds, and when you accumulate a tangible amount, the question arises: \"Where can I spend all this stuff?\" - and still have something to spend. ETS 2 turns at a different angle and you turn from a driver into a manager: buying garages, expanding them, hiring drivers, buying them trucks - all these are now your direct responsibilities, but if all this management is alien to you, you can just hammer a bolt on this business and to continue as if nothing had happened to be engaged only in transportation. The sounds in the game are decent, you will also be pleased with the roar of the engine from the pressurized cabin. You can listen to your Mueyka in the game by specifying the directory to the folder, or listen to the built-in radio with all popular stations from pop to metal, by the way, if your favorite radio station is missing, you can drive it manually. The graphics are probably the only thing you can find fault with, but you don't want to do this, and in the recent huge patch it was pretty decently tweaked. ETS 2 certainly deserves familiarization, if only for the fact that it really teaches you to drive correctly, huge fines for driving on red, driving into the oncoming lane, speeding, driving with the headlights off at night, still motivate you to drive correctly, and not only that. Over time, these fines will seem like pennies, but getting into accidents, and if you do not follow the rules here, you will definitely get into them, decent money is lost for damaged cargo and repairing your truck. Overall, my rating for the game is 9.5 / 10. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

The Idea of that game is not bad, but poorly implemented, because unfortunatelyit it has very high graphics requirements.For me this game constantly had crashed all the time and extreme graphic stuttering also were the problem and the textures were extremely blurry, so that I always fell through the map (most often in the \"Fall Guy\" section).

{"text": "Enjoyable turn based strategy with unique universe. Hard West is drenched with western movies themes: native americans, gambling, robberies and a touch of occultism. I must say it's pretty good mix! Turn-based combat works good but it's more simplified than what we saw in XCOM series. I'd say you can define Hard West as XCOM light. I like the idea of improving your characters - they can gain new abilities by assigning cards (it works like poker: higher combination you get = better bonuses). Singleplayer campaigns are pretty good, personally Cassandra story was my favourite. Graphics looks fine but optimization sucks - no matter what I did I always got fps drops on hero screen. Overall it's pretty good game! You should give it a try if you like turn-based combat and western movies. You won't be disappointed ;) PS. Make sure to check Scars of Freedom DLC, it's great as well!

{"text": "Fun little game - I always had weakness for this type of games since Kula World on PSX, where you control a ball through a set of abstract levels and I really regret that Marble Blast Ultra, which is even more similar to Marble Skies (or vice versa), was eventually pulled off from the Xbox Live Arcade. The controls in Marble Skies are tight and precise, you can use both controller or mouse/keyboard configuration. The physics (marble weight, air control, spin momentum, etc.) are smooth and predictable, which is substantial in the genre, camera movement works fine as well. The level design is OK, nothing particularly amazing or surprisingly sophisticated, the obstacles are simply satisfying to get through and that's it. There are 100+ levels - developers promised to deliver more, it's not one of those \"forever Early Access\" games - all of various difficulty, but the challenge is always fair (there are checkpoints for more casual approach) and the progression feels quite balanced. Above that, collecting miscellaneous power-ups adds some additional spice. Marble Skies runs on Unreal Engine 4, but don't expect anything breathtaking - the game has its own pure, minimalistic visual style and perhaps that simplicity suddenly becomes its strong point. The sound department doesn't stand out with anything special either, it simply fulfills its basic role. The leaderboards exists, but currently they're inconvenient in use. There's also some kind of levelling system along with Daily Challenges where you get gems to exchange them for the cosmetics (such as marble skins), and while the idea in its essence is alright if delivered properly, somehow I had an impression it's not really needed here at all. Worth mentioning is the fact that Birdwall Games promised to implement a Multiplayer feature somewhere in the future. Personally I'm excited about the level editor with Workshop support, which would drastically improve longevity of the game in my eyes. I'm usually reluctant about writing reviews, but in the times when Steam is flooded with garbage software, I have an irresistible feeling that many decent indie titles are quite easily overlooked and rarely gets the recognition they deserve. Perhaps Marble Skies won't go down in video games history as something truly remarkable, nonetheless it shouldn't be completely forgotten by the 3D-platformer enthusiasts. Thumbs up!

{"text": "Gods Will Be Watching is a brutal and merciless point & click survival and choice game. The game deals with issues of time, history changes, parallel universes, ancient races, and, of course, the gods who \"watch\". Gods Will Be Watching has six chapters, each set on a separate scene. The player must correctly assess the situation and correctly allocate resources and actions. Each action spends one turn, during which the rest of the parameters deteriorate. For example, in the first chapter we take hostages, barricade ourselves in the room and try to have time to hack the data terminal before the local \"riot police\" storm us. The hostages must be kept in suspense, both by intimidating with words and kicks, and by calming them down. Having reached the limit, or vice versa, having completely relaxed, the hostage will run away. A preliminary shot in the leg solves the escape problem. Hacking can be accelerated by charging the hack, remembering to raise security. Negotiate with the police, controlling their movements, or bargain for several moves in exchange for a hostage. In general, it is not as difficult as it seems at first glance, until at the most inconvenient moment random intervenes and arranges another dirty trick. The security level goes to hell, the hack freezes, and the hostage gets nervous and can blow up and run away. Spend a turn on a conversation and increase chapter time and general risks? Or solve the security problem now and then shoot the panicked hostage? Or even give the neurotic to the police? There are several options, and each has its own pros and cons. The game offers many moral choices: sacrifice a partner to save yourself, kill a hostage to convince those who remain to tell the code, leave one to freeze to death so that the rest can reach the goal; beat, or even kill the child in front of the mother - all this can be done or not. And every choice can make it easier to achieve the goal. The main character is Abraham Burden, a born leader, gentleman, legend and just a man with steel balls. In each chapter, it is he who is responsible for managing the situation and people. The plot is revealed through rare conversations with partners and characters' lines. I would like to separately mention the partners themselves. They are extremely laconic, each can be characterized with just a few words, even in conversations they are limited to a couple of sentences. For example, in the third chapter there is a need to sacrifice one of the partners for the sake of an experiment in favor of overall survival. If I \"got used to\" Jack after the second chapter, then I did not mind the rest. But over and over again starting the chapter again, you start to empathize with the characters. After several attempts, there is a desire to pull out and save everyone. And now a faceless doctor or a convenient Donald for experiments becomes \"family\". After all, so much effort has been made, and you do it out of simple stubbornness and in spite of the randomness. Not this way. DLC! Additional, 7th chapter. 20 years later, yesterday's enemies have united and are going to \"save the galaxy.\" In terms of the amount of information about the world and characters, the add-on plugs the entire meager game into the belt. What, who, how, why - there are a lot of answers, the game unfolds. Great. Music organically complements each scene, setting the rhythm of what is happening. The crackle of the fire and the noise of the wind from Chapter 4 gives the simple pixel art volume, and the credibility of the situation. The sound of teeth being pulled out from the torture scene makes you uncomfortable fidgeting in your chair. Gods Will Be Watching is actually not a very friendly, sometimes even boring game. The first chapter is frankly boring, while the second one catches only with the question \"how will it end.\" This game has cruelty, a lot of swearing, murder, torture, cannibalism, difficult choices and, damn it, random. But, having provided a little credit of trust, starting over and over again, you plunge deeper and deeper. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "If you're reading this, it's safe to assume that you have an Internet-capable device with all of the modern comforts that typically implies. But what if you didn't? What if you were forced out of civilization as you know it, to live in the wilderness? How do you think you'd fare? Banished asks those questions, opening with a dozen or so outcasts seeking to make their way in the wilderness. It's a humble setup, but the game is masterfully constructed with dozens of interlocking mechanics--the perfect foundation for a stinging emergent narrative and a focus on empathy in the face of a Malthusian world. People, more than anything else, are your vital resource. They need homes, food, decent clothes, tools, emotional support, medicine, and more. Every mechanic, every building you can place, and everything else you can do relates back to that central theme of survival. If you can't gather enough food, your people die. If they're stuck outside for too long, or don't have warm clothing, they die. Each time you fail as their leader, you're reminded of the loss with a grating sound and a yellow gravestone. These serve as a one-two punch to punish you for failure because losing citizens makes it that much harder to keep up the resource flow. One fewer worker means you can't gather food, stone, wood, or anything else as quickly. When children die, it's even worse, though you likely won't know it for some time. As your population ages, you eventually lose more than a few citizens to old age, and the best way to replace them is to give your younger citizens houses in the hopes that they'll reproduce and bolster your future numbers.While the process of survival is never-ending, holding out against the elements amid the hostility of the untamed natural world is a small but powerful personal victory. Villagers have names; they're born, grow up, and eventually die under your intense supervision. Banished reinforces the human drama with its brutal difficulty and negative feedback loops. It's fertile soil for some of the most remarkable emergent storytelling around. With relatively few, well-designed mechanics, the game weaves a powerful tale of empathy and desperation and is a high-water mark for narrative elements that mutually reinforce mechanics. Even better, this is a very human story divorced from the Western tropes common in the loosely imperialistic messages of other, similar games. It's just you, your people, and their strong desire to live. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Depth Hunter 2 is a decent little indie game about snorkeling under the water. Its a ok game for being a underway swimming game and some nice touches here and there. The graphics in the game are nice and like the little details they do here and there. There's plenty of fish swimming around ranging from so reef fish all the way up to sharks and a Blue Whale on one mission. Mission wise the game is kinda short on that. Most of the missions, including the DLC's, are basicly all the same. You either hunt for a certain fish or spear as many as you can, look for treasure, or take pictures. On all the 3 base maps and the 2 DLC's that's basicly what you do. There will be a 2-4 missions that will have you stump for a bit on what you need to find but once you get it done, its a cake walk after that. If you do all the missions and don't do free dives, you'll have the game done in hour and a half to two hours. You can upgrade your character, which is a balded head man with no option to change your character, and have him swim better, spear better, and take a lot of pics. Once you done all the missions you can tackle the achievements and with the recent update, makes one of the achievements, Sharpshooter, basicly easy to get since you can hardly miss now. The maps are really detailed with you able to swim around a downed plane, a couple of ships, a sunken city, and a underwater trench. You can swim around as long as your oxygen holds out, which doubles as your health. You can swim right up to any fish and sharks and don't have to worry about getting attacked by any of them.

A living story more than an open world game like MAFIA II and III were. Through around 15 chapters you relive the important moments in the life of Thomas Angello, a modest taxi driver who became a member of a mafia family. I said no more, all the interest of this game lies in its scenario, as well as in the quality of its decoration. It is therefore essential not to look for the spoils of the game, nor to watch too much live, it would totally spoil the experience. The effect of a bullet through poor Tommy's head. Otherwise, it's a very linear game. No extreme combat, no awesome physics effect, in short nothing that would set the game apart from any other in this price range. Just be content to live the adventure of your character. However, you are entitled to great sensations of virtual driving, very beautiful vehicles, beautiful shootouts with the sulphate, a very nice soundtrack. Well, ultimately it's not gross. Like the very first game in its time finally ... Now let's talk about the bad points, because life is too short not to spend it criticizing the World: The game is much too simple, Even in \"Classic\" mode (which resumes the difficulty of the original game) which is deemed \"difficult\" by the studio. In principle this is true, except that everything is spoiled by the health bar, the last 20% of which recharges after 5 seconds. If we are not too light on the helmet in terms of strategy, we will never die in this game. Especially since you have throughout missions, medikits and ammunition boxes, the use of which is strictly reserved for Tommy. It would be sacrilegious for an enemy to use these sacred reserves. Only the police become a small challenge in itself, since they are very reactive in the face of your incivility, especially on the highway code. However still, with their old sedans, you quickly access in the game more powerful cars for the seeded. To conclude, I have to recommend this game. Even if I am a little over my hunger in terms of challenge. For fans like me of the very first MAFIA, it is a duty to have the so-called \"Definitive\" version. Now I will calmly resume the game to finish all that remains, the magazines and cars to recover. Once the last achievement is unlocked, I will say my final farewells to my old friend Tommy.

The noise, smell and elevation needs are also very nice and takes carful planning. I do like the difficulty of having to balance all your resorces and money so you cant build so quickly otherwise you will be in big trouble I had to restart many times because of this making fir a nice challenge!

A lot of people here evaluate the game according to the game ETS2, which seems like nonsense to me. - Especially when the couple is four years younger. It is true that the graphics of nature are constantly repeated and the experience of the trip is not great, but in my opinion it was a great game at the time and had thousands of fans at its birth, which is also supported by the fact that the first version of ETS was created several various maps or hundreds of modifications. I almost grew up with the game, I played it at the beginning of 2014, then I switched to ETS2. The game is definitely worth a try, but if you really want to enjoy the life of a trucker, the game Euro Truck Simulator 2 would be more useful. the price is worth a try + A decent number of modifications that will enliven the game - Big map, but few cities.

The somewhat hackneyed theme with an amnesic hero isn't very original, but let's say it works. The puzzles are sensible, not overcomplicated, so the game can be completed without using guides. There is also no need to hunt for some hidden single pixel, although not all items are applicable in the game - some only serve to build the atmosphere and add some humor. I found the interface tiring, requiring double clicking to bring up the menu. This can be solved much simpler - it would be enough to hold the button or even right-click. Not a big complaint, but it did ruin the game a bit. The graphics are pleasing to the eye - readable, cartoonish, a bit caricatured. The game is full of humor, also in terms of achievements. Here I have another objection - I don't like the achievements for \"another completion of the game\", especially if this additional pass does not differ from the first one. There are no different paths here, you just have to click through the adventure again. The game is free, so for the price - it's definitely worth a try.

Can't go past 3fps when I hit play. - Physics They DO work, and it's amazing. You build a plane with less weight on the front? You will only make loops. You build a catapult without reinforcement? It will break in half. The game devs are probably fired employees from Ubisoft, and they stol all the physics before leaving. - Gameplay Build things, Duh.Preferably things that brings death to knights and sheeps. Yeah, those are the best things. Big freaking death things that explode half of the map. - Sound Meh. Calm and relaxing. Change this for god's sake, WE'RE EXPLODING THINGS, GIVE ME SYSTEM OF A DOWN OR MEGADETH! - Graphics Not important on this game. It's like Minecraft, it's not about the graphics, it's about the creative possibilities. But they're pretty good. - Early Access Still with 20 levels, but the Sandbox Mode is enabled so you can keep creating things.

I honestly wish that more players would be online to play with. Four Kings isn't cross compatible with PS4, which apparently is where more players of this game are on. As a Steam player, I would go to the Nightclub area and it would be dead empty. And I would be lucky to find another player to play Bowling with me. Some of the music in this game is repetitive and annoying, so I just mute the game music and play some of my own tracks in the background, like from YouTube or something. The Nightclub tracks aren't bad though! This game is a lot of fun with the variety of casino games to play! As this is a successor to PlayStation Home, I do have to recommend this game to everybody.

{"text": "Rate: 8/10 If you know what you are getting Into a RPG based shooter game then you will probably really enjoy this game for what It is. You will not be quick scoping or dealing out 1shot headshots, I dont care that hes wearing a hoodie. Think way less CoD/CSGo and think more Mass Effect/Witcher In terms of \"spongyness\".. If you're gear and weapon(s) suck, then so do you... And I dont mean that In an offensive way, Its just the way It is. PROS: -The world itself is wonderfully constructed. While the graphics are meh, the actual construction of the city is great, and it does feel like Manhattan turned upside down. Trash is everywhere, cars careened in the sides, and hordes of hungry, desperate people try to stay alive. One minute you are participating in a pitched firefight at Madison Garden, the next you are clearing an apartment room by room, looking over the trashed remains of a child's bedroom. That can hit you hard and these moments are the best the Division has to offer. -The story works... sort of. It's nothing special, the acting is a little stilted, but all in all, it gets you into the world and invested in it. You don't need much more from it than it provides. -Teaming up with other players feels good and the tactics of team fighting work rather well. The AI isn't anything special, but it can be difficult enough to give a challenge to your team. A verity of skills and specializations also make different characters work well together, each having a role in your squad. -Customization of your characters feels good. Outfits all work well and you can give your character a utilitarian, unique look that fits the world. It doesn't fall into the trap of one character wearing authentic armor and another a solid diamond bikini that many games fall into. It all feels serious, ingrained in the world. CONS: -Combat is rather basic and even a little mind numbing. Every battle feels the same, no matter what equipment your foes bring to the fight. You use the same two abilities every time, fire the same assault rifle, and rarely use another weapon unless you run out of ammunition. The AI isn't brain dead, but it does nothing interesting, nothing that will ever surprise you. If you die, it's either because you make a dumb decision, or you picked a fight with something that is simply too much of a bullet sponge to kill. -The graphics are meh. If you play on a low to mid-tier system, things will look really splotchy, sort of muddy at all points. Higher end systems remedy this, but even then it's not anything we can't find in any other modern game. The meat of the graphics is in its final product, not the assets or effects used to achieve it. -The combat mechanics themselves are lackluster, reminding me a lot of Spec Ops, The Line. Guns don't really feel different and against the persistent bullet sponge enemies you face, your loadout feels weak at all times. Even the machine guns, marksman rifles, and magnum revolvers come off as piddle after you fire a few thousand rounds at a single foe wearing a hoodie. They sound good, but the feel and impact are lacking.  -The total game lacks depth. If you are going to do anything, you do it by shooting. Want to save someone? Shoot someone. Gather gear? Shoot someone. Fix tech? Shoot someone. Recruit an ally? Shoot someone. Gather blood samples to counteract a deadly disease? Shoot someone. There is just no variety and the core gameplay is too shallow to make up for this. You will grow tired of this very quickly. -I have no issue with looters or grinders and have indeed enjoyed the aspect in a number of games (I even liked Destiny's later implementation of it) but this game just doesn't make it work. All items feel the same, some having higher numbers than others. The few that have special abilities are really just stat increases that trigger every so often. While I love the feeling of opening a container to find the secrets within, the Division just made me go \"Yay. +1 to my stat. Woooo....\" In order to make a good looter, the LOOT has to be special or at least exiting. The Division failed at this. Small increases in stats does not a good looter make.  -The MMO aspect feels a bit... sectioned off. It's as if the entire theory of this section was \"Big Fences Make Better Neighbors\". In my entire play period I worked with another player all of one time, and that was because I used the matchmaking (which can take FOREVER, even on launch day). You miss that special element of walking down the street and bumping into someone else, or stumbling upon the remains of another player's pitched firefight. While areas like the Dark Zone do this well enough, and Safe Houses allow you to rub noses with other Agents, the moment you walk out the door, you are alone, and you feel it. An MMO should never, ever, make you feel alone, like you are the only person around, especially in the heart of New York City. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

Luckily, they made this free weekend and i finally had the chance to try it out after a long period of waiting and to be honest i got totally amazed! i don't know how to describe the feeling but this game is just great.  i didn't had the chance to play it for long because i wasted most of my weekend downloading it but here are some positive things about it: (i couldn't find anything bad about it anyways) + brilliant idea for a game + It's so easy to learn  + solid game-play and smooth controlling + Beautiful graphics, and it doesn't require a PC gamer to run + there is no fancy upgrades or items that gives you extra abilities + all the cars have the same speed and abilities, it's all about you and your skills + you can make your car look like whatever you want! customize it using your own style + full of players, this game is so alive + no bugs, no crashed + played for 6 hours strait, didn't see a single cheater, and everyone was so nice with me, it's so rare to find such a friendly gaming community nowadays so this is a big up for the game + infinity hours of fun  I'm really glad i tried this gem, i want to give a big thank you to the developers for giving us such a generous chance to try it out i enjoyed every single moment of the 6 hours i played but unfortunately i don't have enough money at the moments so i guess i'll miss this sale .. for now this game is in the top of my wishlisted games and i'll try hard to get it as soon as possible i can  for the rest of you out there, i wonder why are you guys still here reading this review? just go buy it now! it's a must have one. 10/10 Edit: as you already know i bought this game and spent more 45 hours playing it, it's absolutely amazing! i'll update this review as soon as i feel i'm ready, stay tuned! :P Edit2: welp, sounds like i never updated it after all lol ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}
{"text": "After playing this game I regret not buying it sooner.  This game is a tragic story about personal loss and the things we do to deal with those situations. Two siblings, referred to only as Big Brother and Little Brother, are united to find a cure for their father's mysterious ailment. You control both brothers, the right side of the controller controls the younger brother, who is at most times quite helpless but he can slip through bars and help his big brother out on numerous tasks. Then we have the left side of controller that controls the big brother, who can boost his little brother up to higher ledges, he helps his little brother when they are swimming and the strenght allows him to pull heavy levers. While the brothers are on an adventure in this gorgeous world which simply is bursting with personality you will encounter varies \"challenges\" which is the puzzles you have to do along the way. There isn't alot of puzzle solving you have to do and it's pretty easy to figure out what the brothers have to do. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning and powerful, whether you are navigating one of the dream like stages where an older memory comes back to haunt you or wandering through the dark and scary woods. What an amazing journey the game gave me, it's not very lenghty but I promise you that you will enjoy every moment of it. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Monster Hunter World is the perfect game for people who enjoy grinding mobs to create new weapons & armor, taking down large monster encounters either alone or in multiplayer co-op, and high-ceiling weapon mastery of 14 different weapon types.    : Action RPG Looter : You as the player accept quests from a central hub location to take down x number of monsters out in one of several semi-open world large scale maps. The monsters start off as relatively weak and progressively increase in difficulty as you complete more quests and increase your \"Hunter Level\". When you kill monsters, you receive monster parts that can be brought back to the hub Smithy and crafted into new & improved weapons or armor of your liking. Rinse and repeat. : MHW looks absolutely amazing and runs very smoothly even on a somewhat outdated CPU. There are lots of customizable settings to tune the game to the performance of your liking. The graphics don't get boring as there are 5 different maps in the base game all varying in theme with each map usually home to a select number of the giant monsters you go out to hunt so often. Many of the monsters look unique & incredible and only a select few look eerily similar/have colored \"variant\" monsters. : To be blunt, the story doesn't really matter in this game. There is an overall plot being conveyed but the gist of it is that monsters are behaving weirdly and the field/expedition team you eventually join up with wants to know why. But let's be real, you just play the game to hunt monsters, and more monsters, and more monsters. : -Very friendly to newcomers to Monster Hunter series; many tutorials, a training arena exists for you to practice a new weapon should you choose to, and the pacing is well done in terms of difficulty ramp up -Hard to get bored; if you feel like you've mastered a weapon, why not choose one of the other 13 to master? Or why not set a goal of making an entire armor set/crafting the weapon at the end of the crafting tree to further assert your dominance over the monsters -As of the time of posting (July 2020), CAPCOM is still releasing new FREE(*) updates to the game in the forms of more monsters and more armor sets alongside those monsters. These free updates include different seasonal events that occur year round to participate in where you can earn special rewards (e.g. Unique layered armor/ customizable options).  [*Disclaimer: The free monster updates sometimes require the Iceborne DLC in order to encounter]. -Mods are available to download if you are interested in modding the game; good variety of mods out there (usually changes appearances of armor/weapons, quality of life changes, and some cheat mods exist if you'd like to (just be a decent person and don't cheat if you are going to join online hunting parties) : -If you are a newcomer, the game can frustrate you if you are unable to take down a monster after long fights result in you losing all progress and having to restart the quest again. Most of the times in those situations, the game is signalling that you should probably learn how to better read a monster's AI, when you need to dodge, your armor might need improving, etc. It all comes down to practice and understanding game mechanics so try not to let the game \"beat\" you. : 9.5/10, a solid recommendation ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Splice is a puzzle game about manipulating genes; puzzles consist of moving individual cells into a predetermined pattern within a set number of moves. When first launched, the cells seem troublesome, erratic, and difficult to handle, but after a few sequences their patterns become obvious, allowing advanced assumptions and predictions to be made. While the puzzles start easy enough, the introduction of utility cells which can extend, duplicate, or destroy other cells slowly ramp up the difficulty. Later puzzles can be difficult, yet remain fair and can be overcome with enough thought and tenacity; this allows Splice to blissfully incorporate a nice balance of increasing difficulty without moving into the realm of the absurd or impossible. Visually and audibly, Splice truly shines. Minimal graphics and a haunting soundtrack add a surreal quality to the puzzles. Even on the more difficult levels there is something soothing and beckoning about the looks and sounds being offered to the senses. For a puzzle game, it is difficult to imagine a style more inviting or enticing. The only deterrents are those common to the genre; if you are not immediately struck by the puzzle type there will not be a sudden change in the gameplay. The puzzles are diverse and interesting, but never leave the general concept presented from the start. Length has also been mentioned as a negative, but with the epilogue, Splice totals just under 100 puzzles which seems more than reasonable. Other puzzle games have offered nearly limitless levels, but often those levels seem to sprout from random generation and not through individually, well thought out puzzles such as those found in Splice.

{"text": "Unfortunately, there is no neutral feedback on the incentive, so I'll write, perhaps, a positive one. Because the overall game for 2013 is not bad. To a greater extent, here, of course, the style of the game, mixing cyberpunk and fantasy, is a very successful technique. The interaction of magic with technology makes the game exciting, the world where people and \"metal people\" get along seems full and interesting. Unfortunately, the game's engine is bad, sometimes FPS sags during a battle, although it would seem that the game's requirements are insignificant, the combat itself is also not very successful, sometimes annoying, but in general there are interesting moments, like summoning a spirit from a shaman or transitions to matrix, but still by the 5th hour of the game it becomes clear that combat is very primitive. With Music, too, in principle, everything is expected 2-3 compositions, but they do not get boring and correspond to the declared style to who is also waiting for Hans Zimmer in such a game. Perhaps the most valuable thing that the developers managed to achieve is an interesting plot, personally I was interested in playing only thanks to him, in order to find out the outcome, not to say that he is some kind of abstruse, but interesting, although to my deepest regret he systematically slides towards the end of the game ... In fact, summing up, we can say that playing at 6/10 is not bad, but also nothing special except for the setting. If you want to kill a couple of evenings in a game where turn-based combat and the distant future are in the yard, then this game is quite suitable, since it does not have an overpriced price tag.

{"text": "There are 6 kingdoms and khanates in the game -Veigar Kingdom -Kergit Khanate -Rodok Kingdom -Svadia Kingdom -Saranid Kingdom -Nord Kingdom Each Kingdom has a king and different lords. You can recruit soldiers from the villages of these kingdoms, they voluntarily join you, level up and reach the highest levels. You can keep yourself on good terms with these kingdoms, or you can plunder villages and cut off the caravans and ruin them! In the game, there is a rating system that determines the sincerity between each kingdom and lords. For example, if you pillage a village of the khergit khanate, your relationship with the khergit khanate will decrease by minus 1, but there is a situation like this! The kings take some villages for themselves and distribute some to their lords. This means that you have disadvantages with both the khergit khanate and the owner of that village. Kingdoms sometimes have feasts in their cities and you can participate in tournaments to qualify for banquets. You bet on yourself in tournaments and if you win you can get back 2 or 3 times more, and the more you win, your reputation increases! There is an extra reputation in the game, you can earn a reputation in battles, tournaments, and missions. Now let's get to the war part: If you see a small army from your army while you are traveling on the map during the game, you can attack it directly. Moreover, you do not have to specify the reason for the attack. In the war you win, you can take prisoners and sell them to slave traders. You can sell your captured lords to slave traders. But if you do not sell and wait, they will send you an offer to take back that lord from the kingdom of which the lord is Lord. If you release the lord without charge, you will earn an excellent amount of Honor. Moreover, you can become overlords of kings and hire their armies from the lords and seek support from them. I would like to give you a little clue and end the matter. Things you need to pay attention to while gathering your army: THE KINGDOM OF RODOK: The most necessary thing when capturing the castle is the archers and the archers of Rodok are the best archers in the game. They work great with a good tactic! THE KINGDOM of the Nord: As you know, there are certain groups in wars; Archers, Infantry, Cavalry etc. The Nord kingdom has the best infantry in the game. Kingdom of Swadia: The best armored and durable cavalry is in this kingdom. Officially, they are in a complete TANK position as MOBA style games call it. Sarannid Kingdom: It is the fastest and confirms the concept of \"EZ LATE\". They are very useful in wars. Kergit Khanate: Its pike is famous. For example, if you put them in the front row, they can paralyze the horsemen coming from the opposite side. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

Especially appealing to people who like crime novels. Game suffers badly because of controls and bugs. These often forced you to restart the game in order not to save your action automatically. The long start of the game as well as the new sequence were accepted, which put a lot of strain on the flow of the game. In terms of choices, sometimes the most sensible choice was a death sentence for the main character. This made them appear arbitrary and badly balanced. The timer for a decision is also badly balanced, as sometimes several decisions have appeared that are impossible to read within a second. In addition, the game suggests many decision options for the course of the game, with unwanted decisions for the story being eliminated by a death sentence. It should also be mentioned that the player is often thrown into a plot without knowing the background of the main character. Despite good hardware, the game has strong lags when fast action takes place. Bugs are sometimes noticeable when NPCs' clothing changes color in a sequence or dialogues are not played or overlap.

{"text": "Slowly but surely, I got to writing a review for Euro Truck Simulator 2, a trucker simulator. Why slow? Because it took a little time to understand the game. Quite good, very pleasant game, quite atmospheric and interesting. I think that everyone knows about its meaning. We travel across Europe and deliver goods. There are some interesting things to do with building your campaign, hiring drivers and making big bucks. But this, frankly, is not very exciting. For most of the game we will have to work as a bum mercenary. And that's not bad, I can tell you. If everything was the way it is in this game, I would dream of becoming a truck driver from early childhood, and most importantly, I would fulfill this dream. This game shows the best life of a simple trucker: he gets decently, fines are low, foreign cars are comfortable, agile and in general, it's nice to sit in them, and what kind of roads are there ... Well, yes, 10 times better than ours. I really like the option with radio stations, because they are real, moreover, the authors tried to include completely different ones in this list: classical, metal, folk, rock, jazz, as they say, for every taste. Radio is really an important aspect of the atmosphere of this game. Speaking about it, I would like to add only one thing: it seems to me that they did not tighten up a little, did not bring in any interesting adventures, any accidents or road accidents. Everything looks too perfect, and this is the main problem of all simulators, it's like in The Sims - a life simulator, everyone is always too funny and funny, but this is unrealistic. So here too, we drive regularly, we earn money, we drive badly, we earn less money and end up buying ourselves a truck, but up to this point it is interesting to play, namely to be a mercenary, but then? Does the game become so interesting after you buy yourself a truck? And then on a new one, create a new campaign and download the character. Yes, download it, friends. The pumping element is present not only in the truck, but also in the driver, there are many different perks for which we spend points once a level. In general, it is interesting to play, as for the purpose of this game, it is more likely to guide the player in a relaxed and calm state. I don't know about you, but I literally fall asleep playing this game. No tension, no bad thoughts, complete relaxation, well, if, of course, you don't drive at full speed. Thus, one day I fell asleep while playing this game. But this is not bad, in no case is it, on the contrary, it shows that the game was a success. Of course, you won't play it for a long time, because it gets boring, but once a week it is a pleasure to play it. And then, some drive for hours in this game, but that's what anyone is interested in. The game has fulfilled its task 100%, who says that it is boring, but what should be a game about simulation of the life of a trucker? This is not our show, is it? This game is exactly what it should be. This is why I give her a 9 out of 10. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Will Glow the Wisp handles very bold and modern graphics, presented in a way that looks like an old arcade game. One great thing that really stands out is the vibrant colors this game features, along with the fluid particles that make up the walls and just about everything else in this game. The 2D landscape that the developers have put together isn't that artistic or interesting, but it's kept simple and very interesting, because it's all made up of moving particles. Another great thing about the graphics is that it is very clear, with different colors for different types of objects and objectives, it is something that is often overlooked but it is the key to a good game: clarity. Will Glow the Wisp runs a pretty upbeat and techy soundtrack. This technological sound only adds to the arcade experience and fits the game perfectly thanks to its up-in-your-face color scheme and pixelated look. The game scrolls through the songs from the soundtrack as you play, which has its advantages: you don't get bored of a song as easily as you would with games that only have one song for each level. When you move your character in Will Glow the Wisp it makes a sound. While this is fine, in the long run it appears to be one of the things you think about and then ask yourself, \"Is this really necessary?\" Will Glow the Wisp is a hell of a platformer. When you start playing this game, you are told that a controller is recommended. Oh boy, at that point you know there's a surprise waiting for you when you play with a keyboard. It's no secret that bullet hell platformers are tough and safe, the later levels of this game are tough but the starting levels are super easy. Will Glow the Wisp has different grades of difficulty in which he ranks the levels, starting in the \"baby\" category after which you play with the levels in \"child\" and so on with four categories in total. There are three characters: one green, one blue and the pink heart, each has their own style of play, strengths and weaknesses. Whether they are useful or not obviously depends on the player. While this game doesn't have a lot of mechanics besides moving and running, there is one mechanic that pops up. Will Glow the Wisp has no hard walls, as mentioned earlier, they are literally particles that you as a player can even move in between. This allows you to cut corners and survive situations where you would otherwise find yourself dead, even objects are made of these particles. - Simple but unique visual - Fun and immersive gameplay - Energetic soundtrack - Physics-based movement can be a hindrance - Mechanics not well explained - rather short 7 out of 10 ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

First things first, Customization - I took me an hour to customize my character. The variety of hair styles, appearance, emotions, voice is just huge. For example if you try to make yourself, it will take some time to decide between which lip shape to choose. Second, Landscapes - I just love, LOVE games with some beautiful sceneries. When i play open world games like this i really love to take alot of screenshots, so this is just perfect for me. Third, Story - Story is like one of the important things for me, when i pick up a new game. Since i have played this only for an hour, i can't really tell anything about it yet. So far i have seen some characters, and some action going on at the beginning of the game. Forth, Multiplayer - As much as i have seen other streamers play this game, the monster fights are HARD, so its SUPER handy if you have a friend to play this game with, because its much easier like that. So this is a really good game to pick up, if you are looking for a game to play with your friends as well. Overal - The game is beautiful and full of adventure. The game might have costed 47 euros, but i am so damn positive, that i won't regret the decision of buying it. P.S.

What can ATS offer us? After several hours of playing, the answer immediately suggests itself: except for a change of location and a little tighter graphics, nothing new. Despite the fact that the map of those several states can really be called rich and well-developed, this is still not enough. I don't know why, but apart from the three Southern States on the border with Mexico, there are no more territories for exploration in the game, while in the same ETS2 a map of most of continental Europe is implemented, along with Great Britain and the Scandinavian Peninsula. In addition, the predominantly desert landscapes outside the window soon begin to get bored, and this is with all the climatic diversity of North America. As for the technology, the situation here is much more tragic, we were given a choice of 2 companies with 4 tractors, for which there are several modifications of the same type of body and chassis, and there are practically no opportunities for tuning. It can be seen that this game has a reserve for the long-term implementation of new functionality, most likely in the form of paid DLCs that are already available for it, but the game is not worth its money, specifically at the moment. As a result, after the game, there is a persistent feeling that you have been bred somewhere for money, but after you have played several hundred hours in ETS2 on several accounts at once, you want something new, and perhaps ATS will someday be yourself will justify.

{"text": "Hitman: Absolution is a stealth video game developed by IO Interactive and published by Square Enix. It is the fifth installment in the Hitman series, and runs on IO Interactive\u200a'\u200bs proprietary Glacier 2 game engine. Before release, the developers stated that Absolution would be easier to play and more accessible, while still retaining hardcore aspects of the franchise. The game was released on 20 November 2012 (which is in the 47th week of the year in reference to the protagonist, Agent 47) for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Hitman: Absolution was met with a polarized reception. Most positive comments were concerning the game's graphics, environments and locations, and the varied gameplay options. However, many critics disliked the game for not \"feeling\" like a Hitman game. As of March 2013, the game has sold over 3.6 million copies. The game is played from a third-person perspective and takes place primarily in the United States, mainly around the city of Chicago, Illinois, and the fictional town of Hope in South Dakota. The player controls Agent 47, a master hitman. Gameplay is very similar to past Hitman games; as such, it is a stealth game that incorporates action gunplay.Players choose how to complete each level, taking branching paths to get to a target or location.Players may use pistols, bottles or bricks, assault rifles, shotguns, fiber-wire, or steel pipes, against enemies if opting for the action oriented approach, or avoid enemies all together, not being seen, using disguises, blending in the environment, and only attacking the set target(s), if using the stealth oriented approach. In the aftermath of Hitman: Blood Money, Diana Burnwood, Agent 47's handler with the International Contract Agency, suddenly goes rogue, carrying out a catastrophic sabotage that includes publicly exposing the Agency. The Agency reforms under Agent Benjamin Travis; Travis assigns 47 to kill Diana and bring Victoria, a teenage girl in her care, to the Agency. Shooting and wounding Diana in her home in Chicago, 47, rather than executing her, comforts the dying Diana, who gives him a letter and asks him to keep Victoria safe from the Agency.

{"text": "This game takes place in Siberian Russia. Domestic terrorists use explosives to derail a train, then attempt to kill any survivors regardless of class or political standing. The gameplay focuses on surviving the harsh environment, wolf/bear attacks, and being found by the renegades. There are three character types based on Russian politics during the early 1917: aristocracy, revolutionary, and neutral. Some characters literally have a \"socialist\" trait and thus strongly oppose Czar Nikolai II of the Romanovs. There are also several references to the Bolsheviks, though, oddly, Vladimir Lenin is not mentioned. Each character also has a secret, but will only reveal it if their trust in their comrades (fellow survivors) is high enough. Having the characters work together to survive builds up trust, friendship, and credit. The challenge is that there must be an aristocrat and revolutionary in the group, so they don't always get along.  : : I recommend it to anyone who enjoys strategy survival games or historical fiction ... or both!

If that doesn't appeal to you - simply stay away, there's a lot of other games out there. The game is absolutely beautiful visually and the music and audio is great. There is not a single spoken word in the game which strengthens it as far as I'm concerned but may be jarring for others. The writing is outstanding, one of the best I've seen in a short game. It really does a good job (better than most) in putting you in the shoes of the character you play. Virgina is short and quite frankly somewhat railroady. If you're okay with that, great.

{"text": "-The game: In Rainbow Six Siege, the player cannot behave in the same way as he would in an FPS like Call of Duty, which has a faster pace, vehicles and the option to revive after being shot down. What happens here is the other way around: each step must be well thought out, and this helps to build an atmosphere of adrenaline and tension that is one of the great highlights of the game. The movements of the characters, the scenarios very well constructed and the communication between players of a team result in an interesting and realistic tactical FPS experience. In general, the matches are very challenging and effective in giving gamers the feeling that special forces soldiers must feel in each operation. - Operators: With each game, you earn reputation points in the game. With this, it is possible to unlock new \"operators\", which are different types of agents for each special organization depicted in the shooting game (SWAT, GIGN, SAS, Spetsnaz and GSG9 among others according to the DLC). Each has different characteristics of equipment, weapons and movements. When unlocking agents, the player can also customize their properties. There are several add-ons for weapons, both functionalities and appearance, which give each gamer a varied list of agents at his disposal so that he can choose which is the most appropriate for each game situation. This is another very positive point of the Rainbow Six Siege experience for its players. The gameplay can change a lot according to each operator used. There is a variation of objective in each round - which makes the game more unpredictable and demands that each player specialize in \"doing everything\". Each round, your team \"attacks\" or \"defends\". Those who defend protect a device or a hostage, while those who attack must recover the items. Defenders have time to prepare, place barricades, barbed wires and other resources to prevent the invasion of enemies, who try to find their targets with drones. Summary: Graphics: 9 Gameplay: 10 Fun: 8 (it's a competitive game, you have to take it seriously) Sound: 10 Pros: Very realistic gameplay; Stimulates cooperation between players; Fully in Portuguese; Variety of agents, weapons and equipment; Very well-built scenarios Cons: Absence of history mode; Difficulty may be too high, but it improves depending on your skill; Few game modes; Some kids, but not much; ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "After a nuclear war, 4000 people survived in \"arks\" (nuclear bunkers). They were in cryosleep, so-called caretakers were woken up if necessary to eliminate disturbances and problems. After centuries of cold sleep, a wake-up call woke all the residents of the Arche, except those from Arche01. The story is played in several times, which results in several main characters in the game: On the one hand, there is Donnie Freeman who, together with a senator, tries to find out what has become of Arche01. On the other hand, you play one of the two caretakers of Arche01 named Mia Howard. It is important to fathom the secret of Arche01 and not just that. Events roll over and a lot happens before you see the end. The reviews for the game usually begin with the words: A Telltale game without Telltale. You can largely agree with this, but with The Descendant you not only have to give one of the multiple choice answers, but also often look for objects that are necessary for a task. These cannot be collected beforehand, they only appear after you have been given the task. The tasks are pretty simple, this also applies to the puzzles. However, you can leave out some things or not do them. If that is the case, one does not die, but is punished in that some of the descendants (descendants) are \"switched off\" by the system because of resource diversion. The system is always evaluated at the end of an episode. The more mistakes you make or fail to accomplish tasks, the more offspring are sacrificed. Since there is only one game and the episodes cannot be restarted, the decisions and mistakes are final. The game went well and looked good too. The Unity engine used has been exhausted well.

Some puzzles may be a bit more challenging than what players are used to in current games.  A large part of the puzzle design revolves around indirect interaction beween the 3 main protagonists via something akin to message in the bottle mechanic.

And in my opinion, it is also the best fighting game for PC among competitors, at least at the time of the release of this game, so for sure. Previously, it was always the case that fighting games were exclusively a prerogative of consoles, and as a rule they did not get to the PC. And only recently, everything has begun to change for the better, albeit gradually. I respect and love this type of genre, although I am not a Pro player and I do not participate in cyber sports championships, but I have been following this series for a long time playing on consoles. In this fighting game, beautiful girls for every taste, a variety of arenas among which there are multi-level for fights, not bad energetic music and a storyline company in addition to the usual arcade battles. Pros of the game: This is of course a beautiful picture at the time of release for a fighting game, a high frame rate of 60FPS and higher, as well as a higher resolution in comparison with the console versions. Many characters, enough arenas, normal company. Cons of the game: Perhaps the disadvantages I will attribute to the fact that it is not always possible to play on the network, and the fact that the DLC costumes themselves are very expensive to play for the characters.

However, there are 7 types of classes in the classic rule, but halfling is not implemented. It is interesting that you can see famous named NPCs (Synn or...) in \"Mistera\", and battle with monsters such as Rich and Beholder, which come to mind when D&D, in an arcade style. The game itself (expressed in graphics rather than thinking) follows the rules better than expected, and the dwarves have a strong saving throw, so the progression speed is slow for petrification or abnormal conditions.

Needless to say, I failed miserably, and feeling extremely down, I decided to stay in for the day and play through the whole game, which took me about 5 hours of gameplay and 1.5 hours of staring at the screen and listening to the beautiful music. This story is different, while still being very emotional and personal, although from another perspective. The storytelling mastery of Kan Gao, paired with his touching piano and cello tunes, is still working wonders to gamers with empathy. I fell in love with the characters rather quickly, and by the moment of saying goodbye to them it got... well, emotional on a rather personal level.  The important thing about this one is that while still being able to make you tear up a bit, it can also give you hope, if you're responsive to the thought that's central to the plot of Colin's story. It can make the shadows around you seem a little bit less dark and everlasting. It can make you think that we are indeed the writers of our stories, and there still are a lot of wonderful things interlaced into our lives. Thank you, Reives, for making me believe that everything will be alright, even if it's just for a moment. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Today I would like to recommend you the perfect adventure game \"Rise of the Tomb Raider\". As I told before, for that moment, the \"Tomb Raider\" franchise consists of three incredible parts.  Rise of the Tomb Raider is an incredibly exciting and beautiful game in which each scene is a masterpiece. \"Rise of the Tomb Raider\" is an adventure game in which both shooting and stealth missions perfectly alternate. There is an incredible level of graphics in the game, at maximum settings it seems that you are watching the movie. Lara became even more SEXY and beautiful, and her moans became even more loud))) In the \"Tomb Raider\" franchise, a great importance is given to special brain puzzles (They are not very easy, and in the \"Rise of the Tomb Raider\" they became more difficult  in comparison with the previous game, such puzzles could take 15 minutes to solve them, which is a great rarity in our time, where, as a rule, you simply need to press the letter \"F\" to solve the goal of the mission).  This game has amazing story-line, with big amount of shocking moments which impressed me very much!  Good: Story-line I Graphics I Gameplay I Music I I finished Rise of the Tomb Raider for all 100%. I found all secrets, artifacts, tombs, paschalks, increased all the skills to a maximum and maximize weapons for 100% I am very pleased with this game and now I very want to buy next part \"Shadow of the Tomb Raider\".

{"text": "And it is super hard to talk about it, but I will try my best. To me many games that tried to expand and explore what games can really be, usually felt either forced (trying too hard) or less like a game and more like a somewhat interactive art piece. The Witness is different. It is a game and it is an awe-inspiring art piece at the same time and not as two separate aspects or layers, but as an interwoven whole. No game ever before, had such a strong effect on me as The Witness. When I finally figured out what it is really about, what it wants from me, when I fully understood the main mechanic, I was in shock, my heart was beating like crazy. Finding something I didn't know could even exist. It is really much more than meets the eye. I should also say it is one difficult to love piece. If you are not really into puzzle or calm and slow exploration games it may easily bore you to death or you may find it infuriatingly difficult at times. It tries really hard to alleviate these problems with its looks and level/puzzle design, but fails in some cases. One could easily stop playing even after long hours of trying due to not really finding enjoyment. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "if you encounter the few hours played it is because this review was based on my experience of the game playing on the BioShock the Collection consoles! this game has a huge difference in shooting games from the CoD franchises and other mainstream shooting franchises that contain history mode which is the difficulty! unlike many first person shooter games this game has a considerable difficulty, that you will die a lot depending on your experience in games of the genre. due to the fact that I played on a controller in the console version (in this case, the xbox one version) the game has a very different pattern of games like CoD, Bf and Halo, but you get used to it very quickly in the little experience I had on the PC it quite follows the fps pattern on the PC using the W, A, S, D to move around, use the mouse to shoot / attack on the left button and on the right use Plasmid, it's a game that you reset in one afternoon for me playing experience I had about 12 hours of GamePlay because I am quite used to games of the genre, I guess if you\u2019re not so close to games like that you reset it in 18 hours at most, one of the main mechanics of the game is a change of substance that you do it on machines scattered around the map that give improvements to your character, which in this case also has enemies that use it, something that both adds to the plot and gameplay is the option of choices you can make in the game between them \" save \"the Little Sisters and also solve some eni game gms. For the time of the game the graphics were average for Bonito, using a very pleasant lighting and a normal maping of a quality above average and great textures. The game's plot was one of the things that pleased me the most (play the game and take your own conclusions) a game that I must have zeroed at least 4 times and a score from 0 to 10 it deserves one for being a game that amused me a lot and in a few years it will be considered a nostalgic game for me!

{"text": "PC Building Sim is fantastic. Simple, yet highly entertaining and with an immersive career mode that will make you grind for hours on end to get the best parts. Just like in real life, except you can't really play games with them. But it does let you overclock the crap out of it, benchmark and then brag about how high your 3DMark score is. It's PCMR in a nutshell, except you don't spend thousands of bucks and you can even go a little further than usual and eventually fry an i9 9900k for the sake of getting higher clocks. Not something you'd like to happen with your real CPU, but I bet you wondered how far you could overclock a processor until it dies on you. Wonder no more! It has hundreds of different parts, ranging from fancy cases to RGB fans, allowing for fantastic unique builds that you can only dream of owning. Oh, the wonders of high-end PC hardware! If you love building computers and getting insanely high scores on 3DMark without the need of owning two RTX2080Tis, this game is meant for you. It will definitely keep you busy for at least 40 hours, and the regular updates will always keep your builds updated with the best parts available.

A big added value with the HD texture pack to enjoy a very good PC version. For the rest the game is as enjoyable as its console version and is clearly on the podium of the best games of the year 2018. Nothing to say about it.

{"text": "One of my favorite games, The story line is amazing, I can't stop playing this over and over. Graphics - Especially for a 2010 game, the graphics are amazing, you can get some really amazing scenery in this, Not quite on the level of Skyrim, But looking over the map is very nice to do :) Gameplay - The gameplay is very easy to get used to, from stealth missions to full out combat, this game gives you some brilliant gunfights, robberies, boss missions and car chases. The police evasion is a very tedius, but over all more fun method, Unlike games like GTA where, you loose the police and you can then drive past them with a car thats smashed up, covered in blood with bullet holes in it and they won't beat an eye, this game requires you to get your car fixed up, new plates added, and a change of clothes to get the police to not suspect anything next time they see you. Controls - The controls are very nicely done, as far as combat is concerned, the aiming, the slow motion, everything is brilliant. As for driving, They have gone for realism with it, Some people might like it, I wasn't really a fan of it, it takes a bit of time to get used to meaning I spent most of the beginning of the game crashing into things and getting shot up in no time, but with a bit of practice you become a good driver in no time, But then again, its realistic, its how cars where back then.  Story - One of my favorite stories of all time, I can't really describe it, but you will have to play it to find out. Its a whole story of betrayal, emotion, sadness but at the same time, partying, trust, money. The story is a crazy mix of family life and gang life. The best way to describe it, is sort of on par with Breaking bad. A hardworking man taking up illegal tasks to help support his family.  I can't actually believe I got this game for free by voting in a contest, The fact that it was a free giveaway made me think quite poorly of this game and it took me a while to get round to playing it, and that was a big regret. This is by far one of my favorite games. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

Arma 3 is a Military Sandbox and it can be modified to how a person would like it to be. Of Course Arma will offer more options such as Helicopters, Jets Mods etc. You won't be able to play Roleplay Servers on Squad like Arma or Make your own mission files on squad. Squad is not a Sandbox just a PvP Game that enforces a slower play by encouraging players to treat it tacticatly and to some extent \"Realisticly\".  That is all..

{"text": "So many open-world survival games have come out over the past five years that it has become very difficult to stand out against the backdrop of The Forest, The Long Dark, RUST, DayZ and Ark: Survival Evolved. Fortunately, the guys from Unknown Worlds Entertainment have found a solution to this problem and transferred the action of their new game Subnautica to a distant planet covered exclusively with water. There is no land on Aqua, so the player must explore the ocean floor and share it with the sea monsters, which in most cases are very inhospitable. How did you get here? Everything is very simple: the spaceship \"Aurora\", on which you were moving somewhere, crashed at the very beginning and all that was left of it was a huge pile of iron and a saving capsule, on which the player landed near the wreckage. If you look at Subnautica from above, it may seem that there is only one void and the sea surface everywhere, but once you dive under the water, an amazingly beautiful world of new discoveries and knowledge awaits you. At first, you will swim exclusively within the limits of the escape capsule, because it is your only base, but over time you will discover completely new depths, hiding intriguing secrets and the ability to build entire bases there. In your own capsule, you can create items of varying complexity and operate storage. Since the protagonist's inventory is limited, and you want to carry a lot of items, you have to choose what to focus on: resource extraction, food, water or gadgets. If you operate everything in moderation, then there will be no problems, but if you turn on greed just for a second, your inventory will be littered with all kinds of underwater trash. Unlike other games in this genre, Subnautica is a very understandable survival game. Thanks to its intuitiveness and clear interface, it manages to offer something new with each new dive. For example, after a couple of tens of minutes of wandering, you will think of creating a larger oxygen cylinder so that you can spend more time underwater. Then you will make a scanner, flippers, and so your character will acquire a number of interesting devices that will allow him to enter the destroyed ship and learn unexpected details of the story, which are presented very competently. And if you think that the ocean has nothing interesting to offer, you are very mistaken. The underwater world of Subnautica can easily become the most beautiful that you have ever seen. It consists of caves, corals, algae and fish, and the deeper you dive into it, the more dangerous and diverse it becomes. At a certain moment, it becomes scary to play, especially when night falls and your path is illuminated by the beam of a single lantern, and an unknown inhabitant of the depths rushes to the meeting. Well, at least death in the game does not mean defeat. It takes you back to the escape pod and leaves you without a random amount of inventory items. On the one hand, it's okay, so death can be used if you need to return to the base, and the path is not close. The only thing that can spoil the experience is the technical component. Despite the two years that Subnautica spent in Early Access, and then two more that have passed since the release on PC, the game manages to give an unstable picture, especially when you emerge from the water. Then the frame rate is practically zero. And on little things, FPS can sag in places. But most of all, the textures that appear before our eyes, which unexpectedly appear in the distance, are straining. Well, in the area of \u200b\u200b\"Aurora\" the hero tries to get stuck in the wreckage. *** In all other respects, Subnautica is probably the best survival game on the market (in my opinion). This is what makes it clear, accessible, as well as a sense of discovery. Getting something new, every time you want to move on, to conquer new depths of the ocean for yourself and strive to leave this wonderful place, because this is the final task of the player. Just to achieve it, you will have to spend more than a dozen hours. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

CONS - There are minor bugs. - Mods are reset after each update. - There is no Russian language. - No cards and achievements.

{"text": "Very torn on this one. It's a \"digital adaptation\" of Buchan's espionage story   and it's about as well-made as a visual novel can get. The voice acting is superb (performed by a real theater company, I believe), the gorgeous hand-drawn artwork really makes you feel like you're in pre-WWI Britain, and the overall interface is sleek without betraying the lovingly-rendered throwback aesthetic. Unfortunately, the story itself is the main thing holding me back from giving this a more enthusiastic thumbs-up. It's essentially an innocent-man-on-the-run thriller, and the middle 3/5ths or so of the game basically have the main character escaping one sticky situation after another, with little in the way of actual plot or character development taking place. Because this is a straightforward novel with no player choice involved, this middle section really dragged for me as chapter after chapter of near-misses began to give me deja vu. The story picks up some momentum towards the end as the main plot finally begins to unfold (there's a global conpsiracy involved, which is always fun), but don't expect much in the way of action or suspense; the climax felt appropriately genteel for this most old-timey of British thrillers. (The original novel was written in 1915, so what do you expect). With those caveats, I do recommend this game to visual novel fans, both for its production value and because the story does ultimately maintain some interest even during its repetitive middle chapters.   This was the first project of a development team called The Story Mechanics, and it looks like their intention was to produce \"digital adaptations\" (their term) of various literary works, beginning with this one. I went looking for them online and was sorry to see that they appear to be defunct, which is really a shame given the amount of skill and obvious enthusiasm they brought into making this game. Hopefully they'll return in another form?  I've never actually read the novel this is based on, but I have seen the Alfred Hitchcock movie version, which is fantastic and you should definitely watch it regardless of whether you get this game.

In the end, it is inevitable to choose those powerful genres; \u2299The strength difference of teammates or enemies Larger ones, and some are too weak. They often have to protect some NPCs in battle. As a result, when the enemy comes up, it takes one or two seconds for a person. If you don\u2019t raise the light point to pull the hatred, the first round of the mission will fail, and it will be in the middle and late stages. There are often seconds between players and enemies, the rhythm becomes very fast, and there is no continuity and tension in the battle, and the matter is over in seconds; \u2299 Some powerful techniques or weapons can be easily obtained in the early stage, the player If you get them, you will soon be against the sky and invincible; even if you don't get these magics in the early stage, the protagonist in the middle and late stages can fully develop into a world unparalleled who beats ten; \u2299 Some NPCs' configuration and many prop parameters It is also very unreasonable. \u25cfHere recommends the \"balance optimization MOD\" of the creative workshop, and configure it in the \"module selection\" in the game after subscription. It is not recommended to add it in the middle, otherwise the attribute props of many characters are already fixed. It is strongly recommended to open a new file and wait for the MOD description to enter the group to check. After using this mod, I assigned several different combat ideas to the protagonist and teammates. In the main battles in the first, middle and late stages of purgatory difficulty, I can fight back and forth, and finally have a tense atmosphere, (npc Finally, I won\u2019t be slapped every time). If you like to relax, you can try the original version first. \u25cfAdjust the running speed and global speed with the help of modifiers. The combat speed of the original version of the game is almost deadly slow. In the middle and late stages, one action is put for a long time, and people can't stand it; when the characters are running, they are the same as slow motion. Modifying the game speed through shortcut keys can save a lot of time, make the protagonist run more smoothly and naturally with the help of light work, and reduce the fatigue caused by the battle time. (After adding super jumps and continuous jumps, it really feels like flying over the walls, coming and going freely, now I want to jump when I see the house...) \u25cfReset the perception, martial arts and other attributes of the protagonist and the npc through the modifier, and modify it The real-time adjustment of the player can modify the play ideas of the protagonist and teammates at any time (note that it should not be over-enhanced and disrupt the balance of the game) to fully experience the game content. \u25cfModify the difficulty in real time through the modifier, so there is no need to manually change the archive parameters to modify the difficulty. \u25cfThe above modifiers are all included in \"Xiaoxing Modifier\", it also contains other powerful functions, such as adding any teammates, npc, etc., adjust it according to your own preferences. (If it weren't for other functions such as the reset and acceleration of the modifier, it would be really tiring to play. The screen is full of shit; the vertical painting and the dubbing are good. The battles are always one after another and cannot be saved.

{"text": "I will not copy the article from Wikipedia and do not want to come up with anything long. I'll just write this: CS: GO is a complex and slightly convoluted esports game that will hardly ever die. The community of this game will be rather difficult to describe in 2 words, but it can be divided into 2 camps: Russian dybily English-speaking community English-speaking Russians There are 2 types of ranks in the game: private (the one that rises due to the experience that is given after each game on official servers) and \"basic\" (obtained by playing matchmaking or competitive mode in Russian) Physics is an integral and rather difficult part of the game. Here you can shoot at 1 enemy with AK47, and hit the one that was behind. It's simple: unlike CSS, CS: GO has more \"realistic\" (according to Volvo) physics. It is more difficult to bhop here, bullets fly up / sideways, sometimes even randomly. And all this still somehow contrives to complicate. An example of this will be the recent update * Tec-9, a rather imbibed pistol, which is now worse than the Five-seven (for me). Previously, it was a semi-automatic with a large magazine and high accuracy, but now it is game with 18 rounds in the magazine and wild spread at long distances. Some people who have already played a decent number of hours in the game and have a high rank (L.E.-G.E.) * This game gets bored because gives nothing and it is \"just a waste of time\". NO! I'll tell you. In the final game, you can learn a lot, especially if you start playing at the age of 13-14.

{"text": "Almost. Here it is the single mum lynx. A beautiful homage to all mothers in a wonderfully implemented, authentic and emotional setting in the wilderness. Although the sounds of the lynx and the other animals are authentic and \"true to scale\" original, the occasional cackling of some birds sounds like the game looks like. Perhaps this is solely due to my lack of knowledge about vegetation. Be that as it may, the music is wonderfully melodic and promotes the feeling of an idyll, somewhere in the forest (or taiga) immensely. In terms of sound, the music starts the next foray for the boys, while the music never drowns out the noises of the forest and thus blurs everything into one another. Shelter 2 takes getting used to. Like the predecessor, the same - one might almost say graphic pulp - textures were used. Nevertheless, lynxes and are faithfully recreated in their own setting. Although the fur does not quite correspond to the animal that we all know, you can still see what it is supposed to represent. You can complain here, but you don't have to. The other animals also look real in their own graphic representation and in no way come across as mythical creatures. Although you could have gotten a lot more out of bushes and trees, you can recognize them as such after a while. Granted, some bushes look like the green ghost from GhostBusters (Slimy?). Shelter 2 relies on its own character that you have to like. Both the controls and the entire game mechanics rely on the simplest of the simplest. There is no complexity or variety in terms of control. Everything can be maneuvered using WASD, Shift (for the sprint), spacebar (jump) and mouse. There are smaller tutorials as an introduction, but they do not cover all functions. Can be seen as a negative point, but since you can count all functions on one hand, that's not so bad. Maybe there is also a plan to find out some things on your own. Thanks to steam workshops and especially the guides, there is help for all those who did not know Shelter 1 and therefore do not yet know what to do. The only change here is in the area of \u200b\u200bhunting. There is a smaller selection of prey that can be hunted in different ways. I don't need to explain in great detail, everyone will probably know that a rabbit is a short bite to eat in between, whereas it takes a little more than racing straight towards an elk (little tip: jumping!). In the end, however, everything fills you up and this review is also finished. Shelter 2 does its own thing and if you can excuse the graphics, it does it well. The game is a sure-fire success and explains itself all by itself, if necessary you can always go to the steam workshop that can provide information. + + + - - - Pack behavior in adult animals would certainly have given the game a lot.

I would like to mention that it will not be an objective assessment, because I am a huge fan of the whole universe and I waited a long time for this expansion. Let's also take a correction to my infinite love for Yennefer <3 But let's move on to the modification itself. As you may know, this is a fan mod (from fans to fans). The main theme is the wedding of our (my) beloved couple: Yennefer and Geralt. However, don't be fooled! During the game, we will play the role of various heroes (Ciri, Eskel, Letho) and get to know new stories or brighten up previously known ones (there are many flashbacks). However, despite the many tasks to be performed, we will spend wonderful moments at the wedding of the young couple. The very implementation of the add-on is a real masterpiece. The world has been reproduced perfectly, and the creation of characters and dialogues is a miracle. They reflect 100% the character of the heroes we know from books or games. Everything has been adjusted to the last button and Redzi would not be ashamed of it! The story presented in the modification is extraordinary and very well thought out. Everything is connected together in an original way, and the additional tasks to be performed only emphasize the uniqueness of this adventure. They bring us even closer to the heroes of the saga, show new events and a new perspective. Also worthy of recognition is the fact of many endings (3 to be exact). I had a banana from ear to ear all over my face! Seeing the references to the saga and the games, I literally jumped for joy (really!) And laughed at the screen. My little heart rejoiced like never before. It was a real dream come true and it means more to me than you can imagine. And at the end of tears my eyes. Huge drops obscuring the screen. \"Something is ending ..\". A certain stage is definitely over. However, I want to think that \"something begins\". I don't know what it will be yet. I feel a great void knowing that this is the end of the adventures of my beloved White Wolf, Yennefer, Ciri and their companions. However, I couldn't imagine a better ending to this story. Beautiful. Touching. Moving. And at the same time joyful. The supplement is brilliant. The creators put their whole heart into the modification, thanks to which they created a unique and unique story. A story worth experiencing for yourself. But be warned, nothing will ever be the same again.

The main story is Yennefer and Geralt's wedding: our (my) lovely couple. But don't misunderstand that! During the gamplay we'll play as different characters (Ciri, Eskel, Letho) and experience new stories or get to know ones, that we already know (there are a lot of flashbacks). Despite a lot of tasks to do, we'll spend a lovely time at newlyweds' wedding. The creation of the mod is masterpiece. The world is mapped perfectly and the creation of the characters and dialogues is wonderful! They mapped the characters we know from books or games in 100%! CDPRed wouldn't be ashamed! The story's showed in the mod is unique and very thoughtful. Everything is connected in an original way and extra tasks just emphasize the specialness of this adventure.

For sure a certain stage ends. But I want to think, that \"something begins\". I don't know what it is yet. I feel empty knowing, that this is the end of my favorite White Wolf, Yennefer, Ciri and their friends' adventures. But I couldn't imagine better ending of this story. Beautiful. Moving. Touching.

{"text": "In Another Brick in the Mall you are the owner of your own mall. You start with a big plot of land and money, so that you can start building a small supermarket. After a while you can expand if you research new technologies like alcohol, restaurants, movies etc. Additionally you have to take care of the traffic - you need to build roads, parking spots (of course for customers, but also for your employees and suppliers). Later you can unlock more accesses to your roads and busses, with that you get a lot more customers - and money, of course. Another big part is the personal management. You need to hire cashiers, storemans, builders and so on. After you hired them, you need to give your employees a shift, so that they know when and how long they should work. Every of your stores has its own employees, so you need to hire cashiers and storemans for every single store. That can be boring with time but it's important for a well-functioning store. Later you can build self-checkouts, but not every customer wants to use them, so you need \"human\" cashiers as well. All in all AbitM is a nice and relaxing game. It's nice to see how customers buy your products and how you make money. The personal management can be boring with time, as well as the placing of streets and parking spots. In many areas it reminds of Prison Architect, if you liked it, ABitM is definitely something for you! + Nice concept + Many different stores + A lot to research - Often annoying personal management - Too much money in the late game *It is a lot of fun to build you own mall and to manage it *Nothing special - but okay for a game like this *No music - only standard sounds like cars *No bugs, good performance *An acceptable amount of content for this price *Many updates, dev answers in forum, mod support *Easy to learn ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": true}
{"text": "This game hides what you really want to express in the details. There is only one core setting of the game, that is, the number of points in the test and the university you go to have nothing to do with future achievements. The entire game content is developed around this point of view. What our parents, teachers, and teaching assistance organizations often promote is that only by taking high scores and attending prestigious schools can we have a good future and hope. The setting of this game directly negates this. 0 points can be an Olympic champion, 400 points or so can be the world's richest man. And even if the IQ is high, if you don\u2019t study the subjects related to the college entrance examination, you will get a very low test, and you can only go to a technical school if you can\u2019t even go to university. It is ability, not achievement, that determines the future. This gave the so-called Chinese-style education a resounding slap. Although this setting is in line with the facts, it is impossible for most parents to accept it, and it is not in line with our main theme. It's not that studying hard is useless. Study hard to become a white-collar worker. However, white-collar workers are the most boring profession in this game. If you want to really achieve great achievements, such as becoming an Olympic champion, the world's richest man, a big star, an internet celebrity, a ninja master, etc., you must never follow the so-called \"good student\" route, especially the plan of your parents. What we have to do is to act against the yin. On the surface, I am studying every day to prevent game over. In private, I am constantly exposed to content that has nothing to do with the college entrance examination and do what I want to do. And stick to it. What is the use of learning value investment for the college entrance examination? What is the use of learning video production for the college entrance examination? What is the use of learning the way of ninja for the college entrance examination? What is the use of learning modeling training for the college entrance examination? But these are exactly what we need when making plans for our lives. On the contrary, it is the Comprehensive Liberal Arts Comprehensive, Huanggang X Volume, these are the most useless. If life is a marathon, then these things are disposable items that are thrown away when they are used up. Two years later, who will remember them. In the game, if we learn the corresponding ability, then it doesn't matter how many points are tested. As for what school to enter, that is the moment when the admission notice pops up. As for the future and destiny, it has nothing to do with your school. Do not do most. I think this is the inspiration this game brought to me. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

The world is not completely open, but is divided into various locations that go sequentially according to the plot, but we can return to the levels passed. It's just that at that time, the engine did not allow developers to make a completely open world. But the guys from GSC did not immediately guess to make fast travel.

Believe me, if the topic of brotherhood were still in the first place, the game would be an even larger conveyor belt. Greece is an excellent setting for a game of the same genre as Egypt. However, judging by the rumors, the new assassin will be about Scandinavia - yes, the game will be very bad in terms of the setting, because comparing the cultures and life of Egypt and Greece with the culture of Scandinavia, we can conclude that the former were much more developed.

{"text": "There are still many topics that need to be \"digested\". One of them is totalitarian regimes, which still have to be defeated in the minds, although their policies and monuments disappear into the abyss of history every year. Black The Fall is a game about escape, not struggle. And that's probably why she's pretty depressed. More depressing than such Limbo, Inside or Little Nightmares, where the hero is sometimes able to give a fierce rebuff to enemies. Most of the time here is solving puzzles and they are really original. Most are the use of light and shadow: you shine rays, hide from video cameras, show the puppets of the mode where to go. Sometimes the shadows hide an unexpected danger, and sometimes they save and it is unknown in advance what this shadow means to you. And the shadows are also scary. Even if it's just the silhouette of an ordinary worker. In Black The Fall there is an atmosphere of decline, from which you can still take out the individual remnants of the old system - the objects, and the ideas, which apparently makes the protagonist. Cracked concrete walls, mysterious cars and, of course, the promotion of the \"right\" system - all this is disturbing and surprisingly diverse. What the game lacks is the unity of the atmosphere. The first third is the real Kafkaesque absurdity of socialism, which is not devoid of even the peculiar humor from which the hero escapes. Here is a concrete labyrinth with its strict rules, in which you doubt whether there is any other world (hello, the project \"Samosbor\"). And this part makes the best impression. Here are the original puzzles, and disturbing locations, and successful references to the regime of Nicolae Ceausescu. The second part consists of industrial landscapes and ruins, where the promised robot trailer appears in the trailers. And the puzzles here are no longer honest, many of them are based on timings. The moment with the ruined church in the middle of building a \"bright future\" (which is almost a business card of the game) is strong, but it is one. The third part tries to put pressure on realism and does it well. Let's be honest, we see such landscapes almost every day in sleeping areas. But it seems as if they are from another game. Go through Black The Fall is worth the time, but it's a game for once. But if you have Limbo, Inside or Little Nightmares, definitely Black The Fall should be in your collection.

{"text": "Dieselstormers: A Tale of Two Orks For every misguided youth of the last century who grew up on a healthy diet of Nintendo and Sega, run and gun platformers like the ubiquitous Contra were a staple of multiplayer gaming.  Long before the days of online first person shooters with dozens of players from around the globe, technologically primitive children like ourselves would gather around our ginormous radiation emitting square televisions, fighting each other for a chance to wield the controller next.  Everybody's household on a weekend was sort of like Lord of Flies, except we had to blow into cartridges before the mayhem could begin. , the latest effort from Black Forest Studios, is reminiscent of those old school multiplayer shooters of the past, but without the broken controllers (and friendships).  Despite having just entered Early Access on Steam,   is already quite polished for an alpha.  Stylistically, the game stands out with a uniquely detailed art style and beautiful, colorful backgrounds.  Weapons hit the various goblin enemies with a satisfying thud, and the controls are well executed with both keyboard and mouse and gamepad.  Though a full featured single player campaign is already included, the real meat of the game is in the cooperative multiplayer experience, supporting up to four players at a time. At the start of  , the player is taken to a main area which houses both their main crafting inventory and the mission selection portal.  The first weapon given is a weak, ineffectual pistol, but with the completion of each successful mission another gun part and crafting piece is unlocked.  Missions are short, generally taking around 5-10 minutes to complete.  Multiplayer progress carries over to single player, so players are free to jump between modes as they choose. Intriguingly, in multiplayer, your character remains alive at \"death\", though with diminished powers and barely the ability to push enemies back.  Upon a player finding a health pick up, the deceased will be revived.  What's most interesting is that death is not necessarily the end if both players die, as long as some sort of health can be found.   Of course, it must be remembered the game is early access and is still a bit buggy at the moment.  During our multiplayer sessions, we had a few crashes and a bit of slowdown, but considering that this is an early alpha, the game shows great promise.  Despite the minor issues we encountered, we found   to be quite enjoyable.   For the adventurous, the developers allow work in progress levels to be toggled in the options menu, what they call \"construction site mode\".  As the developers jokingly proclaim on the options page, \"unfinished content can look like an ork's backside and play like its underpants.  You have been warned.\"  It's nice to see a developer with a sense of humor, and of course   plays quite well, even in its early state.  Of course, it's not Black Forest Games' first foray into the platformer genre, having developed the recent Giana Sisters titles.  Expect   to only improve as time goes on.  succeeds in bringing back that old school platformer vibe, and is the kind of game you can play over and over again with your friends, whether it be in bite sized sessions or for hours on end.

{"text": "The story told in the game is amazing, and its main highlight is the presentation. With a fairly simple general concept of the plot, the developers managed to make a very lively story, over and over again causing a lot of emotions in the player. All this is conveyed through various details, the relationship of the characters, precisely chosen remarks and unexpected situations. The action of the game takes place in a large open world, one cannot call it empty. I would like to look into every corner. A lot of side quests are offered, of course most of them are template, but there are also quite interesting ones, in any case, the game gives out great rewards for completing quest chains. The combat system is completely new, not turn-based, there is a tactical mode with an active pause, the heroes have a lot of weapons in their arsenal, and taking into account the diversity of the local fauna, the battles turned out to be quite boring. The quartet of the main characters came out just fine. All of them are bright and charismatic personalities, whom you respect more and more as you progress. We play as the prince and heir to the prince, his personal bodyguard, future advisor and childhood friend of the prince. And if at the beginning of the game they look like idiots, then by the end of the game you admire their devoted friendship and the unshakable will of their comrades. The graphics in the game are gorgeous, it can be safely called nextgen, even at low settings the game is capable of producing a juicy picture, and at maximum graphics it approaches the quality of CGI content. The sound did not disappoint either, the music pleases the ears and the atmosphere is also in order. Localization, it is excellent, FF XV is completely translated into Russian and not anyhow.

In my opinion, most of the changes over the years have significantly improved the game, but not the balance. The balance is just awful. Because of this one huge hole, you can not start playing this game. I play because I can, because all heroes with more or less strong builds and there is a skill of playing in this genre. But for beginners, it will be quite difficult because of this balance. Let me explain briefly. I have a hero with a power of 1350, the team building system works as follows. It adds up the power of 5 players and divides by 5, that is, it calculates the average. Also does with the second team. In battle, it turns out that enemies with a power of 2000+ fall against you, well, accordingly, your team will also have such. But! How are you going to kill them? If they are much stronger than you. It turns out that closer to the middle of the game, when all the heroes pump a certain level, the balance will be upset and heroes with the power of 2000+ will not feel the heroes from 1300. The talent system in the game is very interesting and I really like to collect my builds for the characters and try something- something new, but you need to do something with the balance, otherwise the online game will not increase!

{"text": "I keep coming back to Galactic Civilisations III for one reason - the mods. The base game is decent, and the in-game empires are interesting enough (and have told story over the different versions of GC), yet it is the Steam Workshop mod scene that keeps this game alive.  The prospect of being able to load up empires from Star Trek, Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, Stargate, etc. and have them fight it out for supremacy is just too much of a draw. What makes it even better is that the mods have full in-game styles, too. So you'll see the familiar shapes of an X-Wing in battle against TIE Fighters, or a Galaxy Class starship. It just works.  Compared to Endless Space 2, the game does lack an ongoing in-game narrative of sorts that unfolds as you play, with pop up missions that can lead to bigger things. It does attempt to offer in-game decision making of sorts, with 'moral' questions that will take your empire down benevolent, Pragmatic or malevolent paths. Each path giving your empire a benefit over the other. Likewise, the diplomatic system isn't as deep as I'd personally like, but suits a purpose.  Furthermore, the in-game size of the galaxy is seemingly hardcored against the specification of your PC. The game will not allow you to run a huge, heavily populated galaxy if you're lacking the RAM. There are times when even the large size galaxy feels small compared to other 4x games out there (such as Endless Space and Stellaris).  Yet despite all that no other game supports the mod community like GalCiv does, and it's for that reason alone I recommend getting this game when it is on sale with all the DLC.

In the game, your every action is processed by the server. That is, whatever you do, it will be on the server. Servers, as you might have guessed, are crap. Endless downloads and random hits are common. The average ping in Russia is 60 by the way. Secondly, the entry threshold. There are many operas in the game with different abilities and it is difficult to understand them by description. Also in the game, the shooting mechanics are different from other shooters. For example, a headshot with any weapon is fatal. At least somehow you can learn to shoot in such conditions in two ways: suck a pipu in casual or go into anti-terror. There is nothing in principle to familiarize yourself with DLS operatives. YouTube to help, so to speak. Third: bugs. For some reason, Yubisoft believes that the amount of content is better than the quality. 4 times a year 2 operas come, but the bugs that were still in the first versions remain. The best example is not detecting a charge / container when looking at it with a bot. Of course, the game has its advantages, as without them. First is the gameplay. Each next round will not be similar to the previous one. Actually the gameplay itself is about attacking / defending the point / points. On them / she can be found through windows / doors / walls.

The protagonist - Aveline De Grandpre is an interesting character but atleast in my opinion the voice actor did not do a very good job voiceing it. The other thing is that the game is not optimized properly I have a decent machine and the game came out in 2012 but it was not running the way it suppose to. There are a few audio bugs in the game wich is not awful or anything but that takes away a small piece away from the experience and the story is a tiny bit hard to follow even thou the game is quite short as usual the game has a lot of collectibles but still even though I got quite a few of them I finished the game under 10 hours. And the game itself has almost nothing to do with the main AC story line but the game is a spin off so I should not be harsh about that. So this is how I'm going to rate the game. Story - 5/10 Gameplay - 5/10 Graphics - 6/10 Overall - 16/30 Honestly this is the worst Assassin's Creed game I ever played (and I played majority of them) but still I got the game on sale for only a few bucks and I'm a hardcore AC series fan so I'm not sad that I bought but I would only reccomend this game for other huge franchise fans and if you are not then just save the money.

In Director's Cut I have 210 hours, and this review is for the Director's Cut  . Maybe the best testimony I can give of Wasteland 2:Director's Cut is that it made me put in 210 hours in less than 6 weeks. Now I might have been a bit slow and thorough, but as you can tell by those hours the amount of content is huge. Maybe the first 20 hours or so I spent playing with my first crew which I then discarded, having learned enough of the mistakes I had made creating it. The rest of the time, 190 hours were divided between two complete playthroughs maybe by a ratio 100:90 respectively. It's not a flawless game and it may be easy to disagree on various amounts of it's design decisions. Nevertheless it certainly is a worthy effort in it's genre, and as a whole it captivated me like only a few percent of all games have done.

{"text": "Melancholy rotating its gigantic wheels, emitting clouds of smoke from huge nozzles, a miracle of technology, created by an unknown genius, rolled across the desert world, groaning. In the bowels of this steel monster, a tiny machinist in fancy red robes rushed back and forth, flipping switches and clicking buttons. Everything flew into the furnace, as long as the mechanical giant drove at least a few more kilometers ... This tiny machinist is you. And the steel miracle of engineering - the ocomotive - will rush you through the wasteland. Just be aware of throwing fuel into the crucible so that the flywheel rotates and the fiery motor does not interrupt its stroke. FAR: Lone Sails is a travel game. A meditative-contemplative game experiment, where there is almost nothing superfluous. Occasionally we make a forced stop to solve a simple puzzle or pick up a few crates of coal scattered around the area or whatever the gluttonous engine of our quirky steam locomotive is eating. What happens the rest of the time? And the rest of the time we ... go. We're just going forward. Through rain and thunderstorm, through a hurricane and strong wind, under the scorching sun and in the light of bright stars. Along the way, watching what happened to the outside world. A world in which there are no people ... During short stops, when we temporarily leave the womb of the ocomotive, we are free to explore the location a little, to look around. And an attentive player will be able to get some information about the cataclysm that shook the planet. However, the free spirit of the game is revealed when you throw a couple of boxes of coal into the furnace and again rush into the distance, on the way to nowhere. And if the wind blows it up, it\u2019s generally wonderful. When the locomotive picks up speed, we want to move the camera further away (the camera can be zoomed in and out to see small objects) and just look at the landscape sweeping in front of our eyes, at the open watercolor sky, albeit covered with gray clouds, or distant sunset mountains in crimson tones, but that's just behind our steam locomotive - like a small child. Either you run out of fuel, then let off steam, then look ahead from time to time so as not to fly somewhere. Our car does not stop day or night, our path is not interrupted. The whole game is like one big road. In moments like this, the game flourishes. The romance of a dying world awakens at the same time a feeling of anxiety and some kind of strange peace. Even in seeming moments of danger, this feeling does not leave. At a certain hour, the magic reaches its climax and a terrible thing happens - you don't want to see anyone at all: only you, the locomotive and the endless expanses stretching beyond the horizon. It becomes suspiciously, treacherously calm among the wreckage of cars and the skeletons of rusting dry cargo ships on the ocean shallow, among the meadows overgrown with weeds and wormwood and arid deserts, where there was once civilization and life was in full swing. Special thanks to the developers for not trying with all their might to stretch the gameplay. As soon as the authors understand that they cannot surprise the player with anything else, they hastily turn to the finish line. And I am ready to repeat what I said at the beginning - there is practically nothing superfluous in FAR, the game ends exactly where it should. Some players still complain that our voyage, you see, is too short. Dismiss! It's better to have 3 hours of extraordinary travel than a few hours of unbearable burden. Now I advise you to forget about what you just read and start FAR yourself. I cannot predict what emotions it will evoke in you, but in any case, it will be memorable hours and bright moments in its own way. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

Some of the most important things have changed with the last update in the game. Now, your importance to oil is much greater. So much so that if you run out of oil, the motorized combat and support vehicles in your divisions will be without fuel, your infantry will not work alone and you will not be able to take a step. Your planes will not even be able to get out of the hangar and enemy planes will destroy them all on the ground like flies. Before your ships can pull their anchors and open, the enemy torpedo guards will have swung into your territorial waters, will be raiding your ports and your fleets will never be. What will happen next? Sailors from the sea, airborne paratroopers and armies from the land will squeeze you into the narrow space and shatter you. The fuel problem is such that its effects are not limited to these. You will not be able to bring external resources to your country because you do not have fuel to give your convoys. You will train pilots, armies and your fleet to gain experience, but you do not have fuel to afford them all. Where is the enemy? You will explore, but there is not a single drop of fuel to put on the plane. So why not? Migfer drank .. No sir, you did not build a warehouse. Yes yes, you did not build a warehouse! That's why all this happened to him. However, if you built warehouses to the right and installed facilities, you would do this. It is not possible to appoint killed diplomats, get up and take things immediately. You do not necessarily have to extract oil in your country, do it, put it there, put it there, trade it, bring your oil from abroad and fill it to the brim.

{"text": "It just so happened that Ancient Rome in the gaming industry is associated only with strategies for every taste. The reasons for this fact are quite surprising - in front of you is a whole collection of interesting stories that you don't even need to invent. But the developers are doing about the economy and politics on the global map ... And here Crytek enters the scene, wanting to release an action game in this era that will simply look amazing. And they did their job - the game, even after so much time, looks just great, which is quite expected from these developers. As well as the fact that the game will have other typical studio \"chips\". For example, Ryse Son of Rome is not particularly fun to play. A primitive combat system built on hit / bounce / block / roll can get bored with its monotony after an hour of play. Different scenery flashes, the plot develops, but we stubbornly run and endlessly chop enemies in the same way. And even finishing moves, which I liked so much at first, are beginning to enrage. And considering that most often you fight with opponents who look exactly the same, it starts to annoy. But, in some ways, Crytek has succeeded. It is, in fact, about the story itself. Yes, on the one hand, it looks as if the screenwriter was brought a handful of different pages from different books on Ancient Rome, so from the point of view of historicism everything is very sad here. On the other hand, why not? After all, the game immediately makes it clear that this is a kind of blockbuster game, where everything explodes beautifully and a lot of \"wow moments\". Well, what has Crytek been associated with for a long time is also here. The game looks incredibly beautiful. The landscapes are really mesmerizing as far as they are worked out. In general, Ryse: Son of Rome is not a must-buy, it is too focused on a certain category of players. If you need a strong combat, or you want to enjoy the gameplay itself - pass by. Well, if you love the entourage of Ancient Rome and are ready to close your eyes to historicity, then the game can please you with the opportunity to touch this era.

{"text": "Hello everyone. I would like to start my review with the fact that I started my acquaintance with the Gothic series with 3 parts and loved it very much and still consider it one of my favorite games! Unfortunately, I did not have a chance to play the first and second parts, so I treated this project with great interest and was glad to look at the modern rethinking and modernization of the first part. We do not undertake to consider optimization, lags, bugs in this mini-review as the project is still at such a stage when it\u2019s all forgivable, although by the way I have hardly encountered any bugs, and if there were, they were completely trivial and not serious. I would like to say a special thank you for the Russian localization for the teaser, after all, it is more pleasant to play and study a new game in your native language, honestly, I did not even expect that he would be there (Although later I remembered that the community of gothic fans from Russia was very large and the surprise went to second plan). As a result, in principle, this project looks good and overall I liked it, the old mechanics look good as well as the old look at the location design (it is clear that the developers did not want to modernize the game too much) Unfortunately, not everything is so perfect in this game, there is and a couple of points that need to be finalized about which I already wrote in the feedback to the developers, I hope they will listen. Namely: 1) The fattest and most serious problem in my opinion is a curve and not a convenient combat system. The crookedly copied combat system from For Honor is not the best choice that can only be made for this type of game like Gothic, in my opinion, the old combat system from previous games in the series would look more appropriate here, this same combat system is only disgusting, and even about the fact that when the number of opponents becomes more than two, then this combat system is not playable at all, I generally keep quiet! Hopefully closer to the release (if there is one at all), the combat will be changed (ideally), since this combat system for a budget project is far from the best option, or it is heavily modified. 2) Blind-eyed post-processing, colors and high brightness in the game. It was very uncomfortable to study the game world with such a visual, there are already solutions on the Internet to turn off certain functions and turn off post-processing altogether, but turning it off leads to a sharp decrease in brightness, so you have to turn it up almost to the maximum. In general, developers should take a very close look and make post-processing more usable, or at least more flexible. 3) Soundtrack. As a lover of music and soundtracks in games, I could not miss this moment, especially after such a masterpiece soundtrack from part 3. Here he is not at all, well, that's straight at all. I think that developers should also pay attention to this, provided that the budget allows it, since the soundtrack is also important, because it, in turn, very well enhances the atmosphere in the game, and in such games it is still very important. In principle, these are all my main complaints about this game, if you refine them, I think you will get a good rethinking of the first gothic. Let's look forward to the release <3 ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

Just when I am getting to have some fun with the trains, all of the busses in one of the towns become end of life and need replacing. There goes an hour sorting that out, back to the trains. Half an hour later, you guessed it, replace more busses. At the moment I am concentrating on moving people around and haven't even looked at the raw materials and goods aspect of the game. I just want to play with trains and have to mess about with the other stuff to get the required money. Setting up the busses and trams is fairly straightforward, or so I thought. Apparently there is a twenty minute rule, if a journey takes longer than twenty minutes then the route will not be used, the passenger disappears or the goods never move. This compounds the micro-management by increasing the number of routes required in order to keep them short enough to not fall foul of the rule. Building a train line can be a bit of hard work, especially for your hard drive. The golden rule is if the land you are looking to build on deviates from flat by a jot, SAVE. There is little to assist in surveying and planning a route, mistakes are costly as there is no undo button. You either revert to a previous save or pay to demolish your mistake. Save files for the \"large\" game are over 70MB.  Placing track is far from intuitive. Things I would like to see; instead of telling me something is too old and needs replacing give me the option to replace it there and then, three digit vehicle numbers with leading zeros, better surveying tools, warnings when a route is too long, AN UNDO BUTTON. Am I having fun? Just about. Do I recommend this game? Just about. If you like Transport Tycoon type games I think you will enjoy this.

We were freer in the old fallout, we have to be nice all the time - a point exp system well thought out but not finalized and not in the spirit of fallout, let's say that the table with the emblematic character of fallout which is in agreement with the perk is good but in the old fallout we had more the points of external competence to distribute like intelligence, etc ... -Incredible companions (dsl but c too easy) conclusion = A nice game but for fans of fallout and bah some points will certainly be negative to you but I recommend it its worth it ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Although the first game overthrew 10 years, the graphics still look good, I started the series with the second game. Considering the option to transfer the selections in the first game to the second game, you can start the series from the first game. A series connected with the Mass Effect 1-2-3 story. You can play by transferring your choices until the 3rd game. We play as Commander Shepard in the story of Mass Effect 2. As soon as we start the game, our ship is attacked and destroyed. Trying to save the crew, we are thrown into the void and die. An organization called Cerberus has been trying to find us and bring us back to life for 2 years. They finally manage to bring us back to life. After that, we start working with Cerberus to fight against other races that threaten the human race. While talking to someone in the game, you have more than one option and what you do affects the course of the story. That's why the choices you make are very important. We play the game as the commander of a 4-story ship. On board, we can talk to the crew, make armor and weapon upgrades, and go on missions. Even ship enhancements affect the story course. We go on missions with the galaxy system and extract the necessary elements from there to make improvements. As in the first game, I would like to thank the friends who released a Turkish patch in this game. We can play such a legendary series in Turkish thanks to them. If you do not want to deal with the door lock, hacking style puzzles that we encounter everywhere, I recommend you to install a mod. It can get annoying due to its being too much. You can find these and similar mods on nexusmod. Those who start from the second game without playing the first game like me can watch this video. The game is my advice to rpg lovers.

You can customize weapons what is really cool. You can choose between 2 gadets and upgrade them for some kind of points or what. Lots of secrets, so be sure you chcek every room for HALO Master Chief action figure.

So, I enjoyed it much, buy it if you enjoy shooting a lot. And Multiplayer: Good old Quake with much overpowered demons and runes like quad damadge (I am saying like Quake) BUT, there is a leveling system and you can have only 2 weapons at time, then double jumping, you can equip gadet like classic granade or (excuse me) \"Personal Teleporter\" (that's really how it's called) but it's mine fauvorite. Back to demons. So they are just uno shot uno kill. You see him? Ha! You dead. But anyway those scrubs have no chance againts me old Quake king. I just destroyed them all. ALSO, there are spawning guns like Gauss Cannon which is freakin' OP AF BOIIIIIIIIIIII!!! It just gives you wallhacks when you aim downsights (or what it wants to be, basiclly when you hold right click) !!!!! So it's just Arena shooter.

(Edited) PROS: - the ability to connect to a quick game in the mission without having to search for friends (you just go to the mission site and join the fight) - graphic design - menu architecture, easily digestible and intuitive - very good optimization and a multitude of graphics settings details allowing to play on weaker equipment. CONS: -Matching the LVL NPC to a friend, Than Me when I am a Host -The game is mainly about playing with friends I do not recommend lonely players because I get bored quickly (I was playing Demo) Friend review.

The story line is a pure masterpiece, the graphics are breathtaking and well done, the world is as twisted and demented as it can be pretty and beautiful.

{"text": "Mafia 3 is buggy, looks relatively shoddy for how demanding it is to run and depending on area/mission unstable. This even after the game being originally released in 2016. If you just play the game without checking out any tips on how to take over rackets it's going to start to feel like a repetitive slog sooner rather than later and that hurts the narrative impact of the game relative to Mafia 2 which is a purely a story driven experience. There's plenty of good reasons behind the games rather low steam percentage score, of that there's no doubt. But even with all those obstacles to overcome to properly get into the game it's still a Mafia game and the gameplay and driving is fundamentally solid and fun with the caveat that the enemy AI can be exploited once you get used to its quirks, then again that's true for a lot of other action shooter games. There's just too much stuff to do that can derail the Mafia game experience if you where expecting something similar to first two games, unfortunately, but once you accept the game for what it is you can still get a lot out of it especially if you take to all the different characters the game introduces to you which range from insane to mostly depressed but at least you got a level headed wiseguy like yourself in Vito (player character from the 2nd game) as one of your underbosses so that helps steady the rest of the cast. A lot of the side stuff can be fun but can be easily ignored if you just want to move to main story along. One thing to note is the season pass dlc is actually quite good and enjoyable and gives you good story driven missions that give certain key main game NPCs further character development while providing you with different gameplay challenges, settings and mechanics relative to the main game. They also provide you with weapons, vehicles and equipment that can speed up the repetitive task of racket acquisition that is the meat of the campaign so my suggestion is to do them asap as soon as they become available. Mafia 3 isn't for everyone but if you are a fan of the earlier games especially the 2nd one and open world GTA-likes in general it's worth a try if you can get it during a sale. It can be pretty good at its best and rather frustrating if a bug impedes your progress but I will make note that these bugs where at their worst during optional side content and not with the main content of the campaign and the dlc (though each dlc also has its own side content after the main story part concludes). There you have it. Another flawed game that with the right slant can be pretty damn good. Hopefully this helped a bit in you deciding if its the right fit for you or not.

{"text": "After 3500+ hours of experience, growing up with this game has been great.  Say what you will about Valve not retaining a proper update schedule, or how toxic the community is, or how much you miss that dead ringer croissant-corpse bug; there's always an incentive for players to come crawling back to this game.  In terms of gameplay, it's one of the oldest and most well-known team based shooters out there. The characters are uniquely designed with memorable personalities, diverse sets of weapons for each individual class, and a beautifully-made subplot in its own online comic series (which can be found on the official website, definitely recommend a read). Casual mode, competitive mode, community servers that support minigames like Gmod's Prop Hunt or boss fights in Freak Fortress, and even a mode named Mann vs. Machine where you fight waves of robots with teammates, Team Fortress 2 provides gamemodes suitable to all audiences.  The game has its own economy, where players trade using metal and keys as currency. What used to be a primitive, simple trading system has now turned into a virtual stock market of refined metal and keys, with third-party companies like ScrapTF to profit out of this ol' geezer of a game. Some players view this game as it is; a game. Others view it as an investment opportunity full of fortune and glory. To each their own. As for its community, expect players to act arrogant and condescending in competitive, micspamming in community servers, people moaning about \"how awful these updates are\", and not-playing-the-actual-game friendlies. However, that doesn't mean there's great people out there on the battlefield. I wouldn't have met some of my great friends today if it weren't for this game. I stuck with a now-dead community named Commonwealth Gaming for five years, became an administrator there since mid-2015, and met the most diverse internet strangers you could imagine along the way. Hell, I even tried to run my own trade server, New Commonwealth, with friends and CWG regulars to support it, and had a good, short run. And damn did I have fun while it lasted.  While this game hasn't stayed true to its form with all the official/community updates and changes it's had in the past ten years, it is still being played today by veterans, newbies, and everyone else alike.

{"text": "Hood. I just wanted to tell you one thing, I really liked your game, seriously, it is the most sensational I have seen so far, it is a work of art, without exaggeration, it is something that, at first glance, could have been done By Da Vinci himself, the genius that he has can be noticed from miles away, not even the worst of gossips could say that we are not faced with a majesty seen only once in a thousand years. I have not seen in all my years of life something of this magnitude, it causes you an indescribable sensation, an immense joy despite not having done any action, a rare feeling to find but fantastic, something like what a breeze feels like in a hot summer, or see the joy of a child when opening their Christmas gifts, or simply be with that person we love so much. Don't listen to the bad tongues who incessantly criticize anyone who does not meet absolutely all their expectations, just believe me and all those beings who consider and admire such a great work of art. There will always be people who are going to tell you that what you did has no value, but the secret is to ignore them, those people would give anything to have created something as magnificent as what we are seeing. Just as God in his infinite wisdom created humanity, or as a man in love creates a poem to express his deepest feelings, or as a painter creates a work of art from some time that even he does not know, this is how it was created this game, in the same way. It may seem that I am exaggerating, I repeat, but it is not like that, not even close, I would exaggerate if I said that I am not before an admirable, incredible creation, of a beauty of biblical proportions. In fact I am so delighted with such a contribution that I decided to write a poem about it, it is titled \"my eyes thank you\", here it goes: - \"My eyes thank you, since they have been caressed, my feelings praise you, since They have been awakened, my heart idolizes you, because you have made him dance, and my being says thank you, for such a delicious delicacy, I will be waiting again, for you to share your joy, even in the middle of the night, or in the most radiant day Just keep creating, creating until your hands are heavy, so I'll tell you again, my eyes thank you \"-. I hope you enjoyed my poem as much as I enjoyed writing it, I would say that you enjoy it as I enjoyed your game, but I don't think there is a situation in the world that resembles so much happiness. To finish being brief, I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart, one in this life encounters situations that make him feel bad, he thinks that he is not going to find anything good these days and suddenly he finds something like that, it is difficult to decide where one he is going to leave his points, and in fact it is already tiring to report most of the games he watches, I feel that many are created by trolls and people wanting to annoy, nothing to do with what we are observing, here one thinks the opposite, he simply sees it and says to himself \"there must be no place on this earth, neither in the sky nor in the underworld, nor in other planets, galaxies or universes, where it is better to leave my points, I have found the true Atlantis, although it is not a physical place, its simple beauty is enough not to hesitate to make such a comparison \". Sometimes I wonder how much skill or how much skill it takes to be able to make a creation of this kind, sometimes I compare myself with the creators of beauties like this and I think that I am not even a simple human being, next to said creators I I feel like an ant in front of an imposing elephant, like a pawn next to a queen, like a child in front of a superhero from these comics that you like to read so much. Sometimes I look up to the sky and ask \"can I create something that can at least be compared to this game?\" \"Can I ever be as cool, as creative and talented as the creator of this?\" \"What must one do in this life to achieve such genius?\" but no matter how much I ask and ask, I never get an answer. Sometimes I dream that I wake up and in front of me, next to my bed, there is a game like this, but in my dream the game has something different, the creator is me. Yes, I know it seems crazy, something as glorious as this cannot be created by a simple being like me, but we must not forget that it is only a dream. If I could make a wish, it would be that this game never left home, that future generations can observe its magnificence and be filled with happiness with what they see, filled with happiness, madness, passion ... If all the games of the world were like this, there would be no wars, there would be no pain, forgetfulness, sadness.

The Crew 2 is \"heavy\" alongside other auto titles and doesn't run more than 60 FPS and something that bothers me a lot, .

{"text": "So, this is, in fact, a review for the Early Access version, but what will be in the full version will be clear when the full version is released. In short: 1) Excellent mechanics of ground and space battles, with boarding, tasks and interesting mechanics of capturing points. 2) Good sane AI if you have few players on the server. And there may be few of them. because the ceiling is 32 players per team. 3) A flexible system of customizing equipment for yourself, as well as the presented equipment, but at the same time the balance of weapons is not very good and there is no breakdown by weapon class. I already have a habit from other shooters, which are main and auxiliary, but here this breakdown is not. Not in terms of pistols, but rifles and machine guns as an example. Even by class in the form of energy or small arms. You can, of course, go through the studies and more or less understand the weapon, but the simplest division by function will help much more. As an option, the shooting gallery and everything is presented there, but at the same moment you will have to enter the shooting gallery. 4) Great cards. But at the same time, due to the fact that the game is in early access, that is, its own glitches, bugs and flaws in the maps. But at the same moment these glitches are slowly removed and soon it will go away from the minuses. 5) The lack of the Russian language, although this does not really interfere with the game, but at the same moment you quickly understand what needs to be done or understand what kind of equipment you are using. The game has a pumping system somewhat different from that observed in most similar games. All weapons and all attachments are available to players immediately. But at the same time, players are limited in terms of various kinds of points, of which there are three types: Battle Points, Support Points, Team Points. The first are awarded for military actions in the form of killing and destroying the accursed adversaries, the second - for supporting the team with boxes of equipment and in any other way, and the third - for the execution of orders given to you and for the correct use of your own squad, if you are its commander. The mechanics of the battles work perfectly well - the class system is completely absent in the game, so your role on the battlefield is determined by what you took with you. The ceiling is limited by the number of points available to you, the number of which increases as you level up. Thus, the evil veteran will differ from the green rookie only in the body kit that he can afford. What, in my opinion. more honest. And more fun. Until you understand how to properly configure your weapon, you will curse everything, and after that it is not very clear about the landing, and then you just appear on the battlefield automatically. And if you are interested in space battle on a fighter, but in the same ground battle in the form of the simplest infantry, then the game is for you. The game is constantly being improved and slightly changed, supplementing with just the necessary things. Previously, there was no training, but it appeared and they already explain what to do, but the dialogue is not very clear and spend some of the time to understand how to read or leaf through this dialogue.

Important to note is that the devs are really open for improvement and suggestions/tips on their steamgroup Being an alchemist with amnesia is, well, confusing. Along with the lead character you're trying to figure out what the hell is going on. The combat is not to easy, but easy to learn what to do and what not. I do wish there'd be a save and exit option, because having to leave and forgetting where the camp is where you can save is a bit annoying. Update: A few patches later the game is awesome!

{"text": "For every player who asked, \"How would Risk of Rain look in 3D?\"   This sequel is the answer. It has everything that RoR has but more \u2013 such as the new characters Artifacer and MUL-T. They also have new items like Lunar coins, new enemies (I.e Beetle Guard) and additional stages like the Newt Alter that takes you to the Bazaar.  Now the visuals are quite minimalistic, with flat 3D colors that makes the environment look more like it was designed using highlighters. However, I see this as a perfect fit to the combat and action as it can get quite chaotic as the level progresses. Any RoR players can attest to this, remembering how much of a clusterf**k it became in the later levels. I'm quite impressed at how well the developers re-designed some enemies from the prequel. The basic Rock Golems to the Greater Wisp and Imps all looks great!   Animations are smooth and fluid through the gameplay in my experience. My only concern is the bug that occurs when spawning in the Bazaar, as I had 1-2 times where my character appeared outside of the spawn point. Plus the occasional enemy or missile chipping through a wall. As for effects, you'd better believe they exist; especially when the entire map turns red, the grounds starts to rumble and you realize that another player has activated the Teleporter.    The audios are there, and just as fantastic as the art.  Since the game is still in Early Access, I'm hoping they'll bring back some more of the old characters and monsters from RoR.    Additional note for funnies, is the way they name the levels.   The final level is \"AHAHAHAHAHA [\u2026]\" lol (Corrected by commentor). I would recommend this game to new players and old RoR players alike, as Risk of Rain 2 is definitely an upgraded version of the first game. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": true}

{"text": "Hello everyone, this is my review of the game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. Events unfold in 1986. Tommy Vercetti, released after 15 years in prison, goes to Vice City on the instructions of his boss Sonny Forelli to control the drug deal, but it breaks down during the course and all the people with whom Tommy arrived on the deal are killed and Tommy has no choice but to escape and not allow himself to be shot, after Sonny finds out about the failure, he demands to return the money and goods, and this is how the criminal life of the charismatic mafia Tommy Vercetti begins. Well, I would like to start with the graphics, because, unlike GTA 3, it has become much better, now everything is filled with colors and not as dull and gloomy as in GTA 3, plus in general the whole game is now not so square and soapy, in general graphics are on top and pleasing to the eye. Sunny Miami, beautiful bright graphics + excellent radio stations, all this gives you a complete immersion in the plot and you get full pleasure from the game. The coolest thing about this game is the plot, which is why I advise everyone to play this game, the charismatic protagonist and very interesting missions from simple murders to parkour on a motorcycle on the rooftops makes this game one of the best in terms of plot from the GTA series. Compared to GTA 3, this one is better in everything, more varied missions, not only murders and transporting whores from one point to another, but for example promoting a porn studio, helicopter missions, selling ice cream or distributing leaflets by plane over the entire city, and much more. the same radio stations became much cooler, for example, the same songs by Michael Jackson, and much more, the game also became more interactive, it became possible to go to a police station or a club, or in the same shopping center you can also buy your own houses, factories and enterprises for promotion of their business, more weapons were also added to the game, just like in GTA 3, limbs fly off from shots from people, the physics of cars is simply divine compared to GTA 3, now the cars do not turn so sharply and do not start to smoke from two hits. In the game, it is also impossible to simultaneously aim and move.

{"text": "In recent years, Steam has advanced into beautiful girl games, and erotic regulations have become looser. It's a pleasure to say that the culture of Moe / Bishojo games is spreading not only in Japan but also overseas. Meanwhile, one day something happens to Steam. A foreign entity that suddenly appeared on Steam's upcoming page. Moe element and beautiful girl element are included, but it creates a strange atmosphere that does not stop there. Its true identity is the existence of \"Otokonoko (Trap)\", which had only one or two works on Steam. A man but a beautiful girl? A woman who grows up? A man but conceived? Majisuka? The true identity of a foreign existence is \"Trap Shrine\", this work. Well, let's leave this as a preface and explain the contents of this work. First of all, the ingredients included are: \u30fb Male daughter \u30fb Sister element (male daughter) \u30fb God element (male daughter) \u30fb Mascot element (male daughter) \u30fb Love element (male \u2715 male daughter) \u30fb If you know I know the parody story \u30fb It is a story that can be completed by spending a day off at the longest. Don't say that the love between men is a little ... This is a true love affair called \"a man and a man's daughter\". It's an unmistakable love affair. Because I'm pregnant. Rather, those who have resistance could play this and open up the world. The other party is cute, cute is justice. Isn't it happy to be connected with that babe? There are two heroines, but please see for yourself what the ending will be! Let's think about whether to put in (purchase) money by playing the demo version once. If you think \"It may not be unexpectedly bad ...\" or \"I'm worried about the continuation!\", Buy it. Let's buy. Isn't the price high? It's a test work, so the story isn't thick. At the longest, spend one day off and you're done. If you worship all over the official website, you will find \"something\". It's up to you to get it. If you are a first-time visitor (first play in the transvestite series), you may want to play without touching the offerings. Use offerings the moment you think, \"I want to know more about the world of transvestites!\" I'm sure a wonderful world is waiting for you. However, it is not a work that everyone will receive, so it may be better for some people to keep their offerings. That is at your own risk. But once I enter the world, I can't get out of it ... I'm new to the shrine, but suddenly I received an offering. Thank you very much. The story is outstandingly readable. Although it is a short story, its shortness is regrettable. And even if you think that they are ridiculous heroines at first, you will become attached to them as you read them. Personally, Miyo-neechan has changed from \"Yandere\" to \"a wonderful sister with a younger brother's feelings\". Finally, Otokonoko (Trap) is a very good culture. I hope this propensity involves the world and develops into a pandemic. I am also expecting to buy the past women's clothing series. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

Before getting into group battles (2-br / 5-br), play for 5-10 hours in zombie solo br (50 players with a huge map where there will be more loot and everyone will be able to get lost) 2. A car is a very necessary item except for a solo zombie br (there are no cans of gasoline) found a car? immediately fly away on it in search of new cars (take gasoline from them) and loot in remote places from the spawn =) 3. Did you see the car? one should not rejoice in advance, since there may not be a candle there (without a candle it will not start) what to do? score on the car (the best option) or sit down and wait for the owner of the car (not the fact that he will come) 4. Did you see the airdrop? do not fly there faster than anyone (usually there is almost nothing on 1 drop + there is a chance of an ambush) 5. While running to the safe, did the smoke cover the zone? it doesn't matter if we use the medical kit and run further (hp cannot go down because of a strong heal of hp) 6. You will burn if you play 2-br / 5-br with left people! why? 99% chance they will kill you for loot or fun 7. Tired of your fingers from running? press \"+\" and the character will run automatically (you can move away or close the game, he will run further) Bottom line: Now you are ready to plunge into H1Z1 and start bending down How to do this?

The game takes place in the mansion of Lord Mortimer, where you will spend all 5 episodes. You come here to find your mother. In the course of the plot, the identity of the owner of the place is revealed. Each episode is equipped with puzzles of different levels of difficulty, which will make you think for 5 minutes or half an hour. Earlier, it was mentioned about the possibility of improving skills - with the help of them you can get hints, which will make your task easier. For example, with the improved \"linguistics\" skill, you can easily translate foreign books and records. The game takes place in the modern era - the period of wealthy aristocrats, as well as the first president of the United States. It is with these characters that you will come across in the course of the game. If you have already completed the most famous and praised projects by players, where your decisions can have certain consequences, it makes sense to take a liking to this game.

{"text": "It is a must have for every gamer, it must be tried above all for its Nemesis system which is what makes it unique. In terms of action, it is everything a fan of the genre would like: frenzy, blows, severed limbs and catharsis. Responding to some common criticisms I see in other reviews: yes, the gameplay is influenced by other action, but which video game has no shades of others? The important thing is that he brought something new. Regarding the difficulty: the game is mostly easy, especially when you get carried away, but the DLC of the Shining Lord is rather difficult and the challenges (option outside the story mode) will give their teeth even for hardcore gamers. The scandal of youtubers paid to talk well about it was na\u00efve because the game really didn't need any more publicity at all, the nemesis was interesting theoretically and it was in game. The music is exciting, it refers to films but at the same time has its own reason for age. The characters are shallow but their \"toughness\" or their being a little more realistic and less likely to always do the right thing makes them somewhat pleasant: Talion is a tough and vengeful man and the ghost is even more so. . The graphic system does its duty. : in my opinion there is no need to set it in the middle ground, they could easily invent a new ip, with a new lore and new and fresh characters, but obviously LOTR was used for a specific reason.

As with nearly all the updates and DLC, Paradox really cares about this game. I think one big issue people have with this game, is that it keeps releasing DLC. Which is a valid issue, but you have to realize that the fact that DLC is still being released, means that Paradox cares enough to work on the game more and more. The argument that \"this game should have been released finished\" or that \"Paradox is just milking money from blind consumers\" seems asinine. If they simply released Stellaris and left it alone similar to other Paradox games, I have doubts that it would ever be as popular as it is now. The constant changes and updates keep making the game better. \"But what about mah moneyyy I dont like dlc bc it costs money.\" Oh shut up, the DLC is the only way Paradox can be supported as a game developer. Rather than just re-releasing the same game over and over again like some certain studios *ahem* EA *ahem*. People say that Paradox is worse than EA for the constant releasing of DLC, well I think the math otherwise checks out that even if Paradox releases constant DLCs, it still comes out cheaper than the yearly re-release of Fifa.  TL;DR Stellaris is a great game, please support Paradox by buying the DLC to support them and make the game better. Also don't hate on Paradox for releasing said DLC.

{"text": "EDIT: After going through a second playthrough, I have some added thoughts. I stand by the original review and it have not changed it or removed anything, but have added some final thoughts. Alright... Let's start with the negatives. There are a few. There are quite a few bugs, most of them minor annoyances (EDIT: See the end for how these minor annoyances became a lot more major.). But I have through one complete playthrough and well into the second one encountered two quest bugs that make it impossible to finish those quests. In the first case it was annoying, but didn't really ruin anything for me. The second one, however is a pretty big deal and almost causes me to turn on this game. I have decided not to continue with that playthrough until this is fixed. I should note that I had no problems at all with the same qeust on the first playthrough. This is not acceptable in a game that has had such a long ( and open) development time. There are minor technical issues here and there but I have not experienced anything bad. With that out of the way - This in an incredible game when it comes to story, plot, characters, atmosphere, lore and worldbuilding. It is well worthy of its claim as successor to Planescape: Torment. The protagonist is slightly less interesting than in P:T but the progression and decisions make up for it. There is an army of characters and quests, mostly very well done and varied. If you're not ready to read, and lots of, then this is NOT the game for you. The sheer amount of written dialogue and descriptions is staggering and very well done. If you're expecting action then, again, this game is NOT for you. There are few combat situations and most potential combat situations can be avoided through conversations and skills. It's a plus in my eyes but some may disagree. As a matter of fact there is no actual combat situation - it's referred to as Crisis and can be resolved in many ways, including but not limited to combat. The combat system is turn based and old-school gamers will be very familiar with the good and bad of such. I like it but it can be on the tough side. The character progression is fairly traditional and easy to learn but may not be for everyone. It's the ol' fashioned 'get a bunch of XP and level up' but with the added wrinkle that there are four levels / tier. You can only do so much every level but gain new abilities at every tier. The characters are pretty weak to begin with and get more versatile and powerful with time - no big surprises there. Long story short, this is a very good game worth the wait (I kickstarted it back in 2013) but it sure as hell isn't for everyone. It's an incredible world and story with a lot of great content but it absolutely will not appeal to those seeking a fast pace and/or action. This is a game that takes its time and rewards patience and immersion. That's my thing, may not be yours. But is sure isn't perfect. Finally (this will be a personal gripe, by all means stop reading if you're satisfied so far) I cannot, for the life of me, understand a looooooot of the other reviews for this game. I see an awful lot of complaints about the lack of action and combat and complaints about the amount of text. I don't mean to be rude, but it has been purdy clear from day one that this would never be a game drowning in action nor lacking in reading and lore. So I stress, again, if you're looking for action this just isn't the game for you. EDIT: I went through and finished a second playthrough. Using some player knowledge of the quests, I managed to completely avoid any such bugs and could do (and finish) all the quests. I still think this is a very well written and thought out game, story, plot etc. I also still think it will never appeal to everyone, but then people forget that nobody bought Planescape: Torment on release and it took years for people to understand what a remarkable game that was. In my personal instance, I alone in my group of friends bought and/or thought it was special. That's the good news. There's just no way around it, this is a buggy mess. I've lost count of the number of issues I've experienced but they've ranged from tiny annoyances to game-breaking in a sense. I had to effectively restart a playthrough from scratch becuase of a quest bug. Late game I had to relaod the same encounter repeatedly because my character was knocked down for -1 round, which so completely baffled the program that I was stuck. I've had a situation almost at the end of the game where I was basically stuck because I was given a 110% chance at succeeding at a task. But the thing about bugs is that they can be fixed and I have a feeling inXile could have really used a few more months, but wouldn't have dared to delay once again.  The positives of the game, as far as I'm concerned, still far outweigh the negatives. But I repeat once more that this game will never appeal to everyone. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

I can assure you of the fantastic experience you live when introducing you to this Sonic adventure and I don't know if it is because of nostalgia or because it is simply wonderful by itself in all its aspects. Speaking both visually and instrumentally, each moment brings me a little memory. I went through the different levels collecting the chaos drive to which I never got angry for the same thing that I wanted to see my chaos evolve. So much was my love for this game that I still keep the physical format and the memory card where my chaos are.

If you don't have the ability to play with a gamepad, download an emulator or play with keyboard, improvise! Also, the description indicated the presence of Russian subtitles. If you, like me, went into the settings to activate the subs, because you don't understand \"Japanese\", don't be angry bro! You are not alone. This is not Japanese at all, but a fictional gaming language. There are no subtitles, respectively. Let's move on to the game itself. She is a masterpiece. Drama is drama, from beginning to end. Not that everything is a complete depression, but most likely partial. We have two brothers to play. Some ailment struck their father and only a medicine located far away will cure him. Loving sons will do anything to save papa and begin their long journey. Probably, we all know the phrase \"Brother for Brother\"! The principle will be just like this almost throughout the passage. Only together. For the older brother - strength, for the younger - agility. While playing, we will watch how the younger brother struggles with his fears. The actions of the brothers speak of themselves. The younger one wants to frolic, the older one gets to the goal as soon as possible. In all locations there are benches, sitting down on which, we can focus on the environment. The variety of side quests will not let you get bored. The game is very similar to the JRR Tolkien universe. Most likely, the developers fed forces from Scandinavian myths. This game is like a good book that will forever remain in my and your hearts!

{"text": "I had very high expectations for this title and I was severely disappointed by the final product so let me start by pointing out the issues before delving deeper into what the game does right. Right off the bat, after starting the game I was greeted by a gamebreaking bug that completely broke the scrolling for me (which mind you, is pretty much the entire gameplay). The text would randomly jump all over the place and the only way to keep it at the bottom (so I could select the dialog options) was pressing middle mouse bottom then holding the down arrow on the keyboard. I've tried different mice and the problem persisted. Also the game has no controller support (or at least the ones I had didn't work at all) and no option to run the game in borderless windowed mode. The main selling point of this game, which is the story, is done rather well for the most part with a few exceptions. The writing is excellent overall and the narrative is easy to follow up until the ending. The ending, while not terrible by any means, leaves a lot to be desired. There are only two endings and one of them makes absolutely no sense at all without understanding a minor detail that's not explicitly mentioned in the game (but is somewhat implied). Nevertheless, the consequences of your choice at the end is only left to your own imagination as the game abruptly ends there with no sense of closure or epilogue. The ending feels extremely rushed and incomplete, thus ruining the whole experience. Additionally, the \"Architects\" subplot and whole \"religious\" aspect of the game is done rather poorly and could certainly use some more work. There's not much to say about the gameplay, if you could call it that, since the entire game is just a series of dialog choices. It is a text-based adventure after all. The music accompanying the walls of text that are NOT voiced is rather boring and uninspired. The visuals are beautiful overall, although I feel like there's a bit too much post-processing going on that makes it look better than it actually is but that's just my personal opinion since I hate bloom and motion blur with a passion. - Artwork gallery - Excellent writing quality - Intriguing story with two endings - Interesting developer commentary - Appealing visuals and beautiful artwork - Ability to replay certain dialog sequences - Multiple choices and branching side stories - Great character design and development (with the exception of the protagonist) - Gameplay solely consists of dialog choices and some VERY light puzzles - No voice acting - Terrible puzzles - Extremely short - Confusing ending - Little to no replay value - Gamebreaking scrolling bug - No gamepad or controller support - No borderless windowed mode support - Monotonous soundtrack and poor audio quality overall  6.5/10 - Decent Subsurface Circular is by no means a masterpiece, far from it in fact as it has some glaring issues and a lot of room for improvement. It's nowhere even close to being a great game for that matter, but I do believe it can be worth the asking price for a certain niche group of gamers. If you're into text-based adventures with decent stories and branching paths, you should give this game a chance, especially if you can pick it up on a sale.

As a result, his world discovered the parallel world shuttle, so he sold his daughter to the sky city.

{"text": "The first unknown of all has been the choice of voices. It is famous that Spanish is very bad, I have tried it and although I find it exaggerated what is said if it is malillo, then in English but the fucker has errors in the pronunciation of her own names or she invents them. At the end I have put it in Polish, which seems strange to me especially when they speak a lot for a short sentence. Another point in which it is famous is having a very bad gameplay in the fighting system and I strongly disagree. The system is based on clicks with the mouse to attack but slowly, each click an attack and at the right moment another click to chain combos (which are unlocked if you acquire the ability when leveling up), with the right click you do magic (for now as a sling of force) that serves to move away and throw them to the ground. The directions if you give it twice in a row, it makes a quick movement to dodge (somersault, jump etc.) a priori is not a big deal, but when you are surrounded it goes well and you gain a few seconds to attack without being surrounded, apart from that it is cool. Although I admit that that great system with the hours is tarnished, the idea is good but it needs to be polished and it shows that it fails several times when you want to do some dodges. It also has three styles. A slow one for big men, a fast one for little ones and a group one in case they surround you. All this accompanied by a pretty good skill tree and a potion system that enhances skills. I would already like that for example the Nerver winter nights had this system to say one. Following another very famous point that is said, the spoilers with the books, contrary to what is read and heard, this game has important spoils of the game, those who are interested in books, read them first. To finish and not least, both the main plot and the secondary ones have a more than decent level and it knows how to maintain interest with a style reminiscent of the literary saga, especially to discard some secondary ones, these had that touch of independent stories that it has the first two books. Although it suffers from messenger missions but these sometimes can give interesting rewards. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Absolutely incredible game bursting with charisma and personality, fast, robust and satisfying combat with interesting and likeable characters. This is honestly a better action game than DMC 4 and if DMC 5 didn't come out, the DMC brand as a whole imo wouldn't even compete with the likes of this. The set pieces, the combat, the characters, everything is literally taken up to 11 to a point that I found myself not having this much fun in a DMC game with the exception of 3. I can now see why DMC 4 turned out the way it did and I highly doubt if Hideki Kamiya made it, it would've been the same and this game clearly shows that.  Starting with the technical aspects which seem to be pretty damn good. It isn't RE2 remake or Gears 5 good but I can see that a lot of effort was still put in although I do have a few gripes. Firstly, G-Sync doesn't work even though this port was made fairly recently. Secondly, there is no Move list editor to make it so punching is square like DMC which I heard was unnecessarily not included in the original, so you'll have to go through the Steam Overlay to switch up buttons which is kind of naive for a release this recent that could've easily been included and lastly, ALL cut scenes, even the the in game ones, are 30FPS, even though it isn't that big of a deal, it could've easily been avoided for a release this recent.  Now that I'm done with that, I will now talk about the actual game which is just \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 amazing. With the exception of the poorly told story they shove in your face at the beginning, in a dialogue dump told while your expected to fight dozens of enemies and a particular boss that repeats himself several times over but besides that, I loved everything else about this game and I think this may be one of my favourite action games of all time. It just makes you wonder the kind of crazy $hit Platinum Games could come up with, if they were given the DMC green light, like Metal Gear Solid. Its also surprising how much I enjoyed this game because of the absolute garbage intro but was then quickly forgotten by some of the craziest set pieces and combat that I think I've seen in gaming. I'll now list just why this game blew me away like it did starting with: 1) The combat which is just spectacular. Enemies are actually aggressive and dodging at exactly the right time activating witch time fits fairly well with the combat. Very few games other than DMC have combat this refined and deep that just never gets old for me. 2) The Jeanne fight alone deserves its spot. 3) Very replayable due to the accessories and moves taking many many completions of the campaign to acquire them all. It also makes all your play through's vastly different due to all accessories being completely different from each other and only 2 actually being able to be equipped simultaneously and costumes costing a whole lot and having hefty and obscure requirements that can have you play this game 10 times and never get the same experience. Its replay-value I've never seen in a game in my life, much better than DMC 5's  imo 4) Vastly varied and unique character designs. 5) Ever-changing and dynamic situations that put you in interesting sequences. From being on a motorbike, to riding on a missile, I felt like the developers constantly strived for progression in this game to genuinely be different from whatever was before it and I commend the effort that was put in. Even though some people do hate the motorcycle sequence, I on the other hand appreciate it.   6) Mind blowing set pieces and cut scenes that I couldn't get enough of.  7) Ridiculous off the walls ending that just gets more insane as you go.  With all its positives and its surprisingly few negatives, I think it deserves a very high 9/10 which I truly think it deserves and is quite a rarity if you've seen my score list. If the story wasn't so poorly told at the beginning and quite hard to completely grasp to begin with, it could've just gotten away with a 9.5/10. I honestly think its that damn good and if you are a fan of the DMC franchise or action games in general and haven't picked this up, then its blind buy worthy if you have even a slither of a bit of interest in the game or the man who directed the first DMC and were he took his DMC influence and ideas.

{"text": "Here is a revew 2 monts after relase from a dedicated multiplayer player and a real fan of Warhammer 40k. - General impressions, lore, setting: The game has managed to perfectly capture the Warhammer 40k universe. Everything from graphics, animations, sounds, music, interface breathes and lives Warhammer 40k. Especialy how all factions are done very close to the table top game from which it gets it's name and gameplay, and how unique their ships, captains, effects and sounds are made to fit their own interface in multiplayer. Do remember that this is an RTS and not a turn based game. - Singleplayer I am more of a multiplayer player in these kinds of games so I have only scratched the surface of the singleplayer. What I can say is that it's a well paced campaign with a detailed progression system that has severl options for difficulty and an Iron man mode. The AI is very competnent and will give you a good game each time. - Multiplayer This part has it's good and bad sides. Yes, there is a interesting progression system, no it's not well balanced for new players. Yes, it's deep and interesting with lot's of room for experimentation, no it doesn't let you win with every setup. Yes, there is 2vs2, but it's very limited by the Engine(UE4) to only 1-3 ships. 1vs1 can get up to 6 capital ships. Yes, there are skill shots, abilities, no they don't fit the gameplay that well.  Do note that the Developers have been fixing these problems from day 1. There is a higher limit on ships for 2vs2, there are less powerfull skillshots and abilities. Matchmaking is still not fully implemented as for 23.06.2016. ELO is not public, there is no ranking atm which will be coming in a free patch. Player base is around 300+ players 24/7 with peaks to over 2500 when a new faction for MP hits, 99.999% well manared, non cheater, fun to play against. In all of my MP experiance I haven't found better. Base game offers 4 factions, with new DLC it's 5, 6th is in the works, and aditional ones are to be announced. Balancing patches are regular and fix more problems then they create. - Stability, patching, servers After two months after release there are no major problems. Game runs excellently with no fps drops if set to your PCs proper limit. You can play vs other players from all over the world, while you can also chose which areas you want to play in, so if you are in US and don't want to play vs players in Asia, for the fear of high ping, you can chose not to. Patching has been fast and slow at the same time. Some weeks bring 3 patches others 0. But what is most important Developers are listening 100% and take and implement all good player requested features.  - Closing thoughs This is one of those games that gives more then it charges for, especially if you are a fan of the setting amd lore. RTS players who like no base building RTS games are going to love the game. The game and it's features have more to offer, I haven't even covered the vs AI custom battles or Co-Op vs AI.

I began to blindly pursue the quality, gameplay and plot of the game, but forgot the original intention of playing the game at the beginning. I would only continue to insult the game manufacturer (), hit the keyboard angrily, and then complained looking at my inventory and the mouse sliding Time after time, but still can't find the motivation to open a game to download. I have forgotten the last time I played a game happily, enjoyed the joy that the game brought me, and then was moved by this game. I pre-ordered 3A masterpieces time and time again, but I never got the kind of satisfaction I wanted. In the end, he could only slowly grow ashes in the inventory. I sighed my sorrow time and time again, but I always buy more games to satisfy my inner vacancy for games. The uninstallation of the right mouse button is more and more frequent, and the hard disk of the computer is gradually increasing, but it will only silently mourn why there is no good game. The styles of the recommended games in the store are getting richer and richer, and all kinds of prosperous games mark the eye, but there is no novel interest in the game at the beginning. The laughter that used to accompany me playing games gradually turned into abusive. The performance of the computer becomes stronger with my needs. Blindly pursuing a goal that made me lost, I forgot what I was pursuing at the beginning.

Enjoyed all kinds of delicacies of mountains and seas, but forgot the sweetness of mother's cooking. After writing so much, I don\u2019t want to complain about anything. I just feel that the game is becoming more and more prosperous, and the requirements for configuration are getting higher and higher, but the players have not been satisfied. GalGame has always won many fans with its simple game style. The plot brought many players moved and laughed. When I complained about the lack of good games, I ignored that there are actually many games around that can bring me laughter. And the thousands of love in this pomelo club have brought me a lot of joy. I don\u2019t think about anything when I am playing. I am attracted by these simple and interesting dialogues and make me laugh. After playing the plot, I I will have the urge to play again and enjoy the fun this game brings me. This is a plot I haven't had recently. So I really recommend this game to those players who don\u2019t know what game to play like me.

{"text": "Silver Chains produced by Cracked Heads Games and distributed by Headup brings a handful of scares and a melancholy soundtrack, The game starts with the character Peter, waking up in a Victorian era mansion, apparently abandoned, with no memory of how he got there. Like any good exploratory horror game, the simple setup and confidence in the amnesiac hero gradually let players understand the truth behind the strange mansion. It's a game about exploring a fetid-looking mansion with lots of empty space, hunting the next trigger that progresses in history and occasionally escaping an immortal enemy. With the volume turned up on your headphones late at night. Silver Chains features several sequences in which the player must hide from supernatural threats that hover over the old mansion. The game renounces traditional collectible items in favor of a good dose of memories, such as diary notes and old photographs that reveal the story and often present Peter's thoughts narrated to the player. In the beginning, players will have their first encounter with the most significant threat, the hideous, downcast matriarchal resident. Silver Chains has no combat. Instead, players will have to find places to hide or simply flee whenever they encounter an enemy inside the mansion. There are a small handful of puzzles, besides just looking for the right place to be at any given time, none of which is particularly memorable. After discovering a magic monocle, you can activate it to find the next access point, which ends up being the main tool of the game to progress in history, a functional decision, but without mechanical inspiration. In addition, several other unimaginative horror game mechanics appear - doors that don't open, except when they should, doors that can't even be interacted with, but that open for unexplained reasons later, random garbage in the way that prevents your game navigation as a force field and convenient blackouts that allow the player to be transported quickly to the next important scenario. Overall, the title does a good job of maintaining that cat-and-mouse dynamic as players progress through the mansion. it's a beautiful game, everything from the old, chipped paint on the walls to the scary and atmospheric sound effects that help to create a believable and gothic atmosphere. At best, he seems to be reading a Victorian-era novel, like Dracula, particularly, in the sequences where the player is faced with diary entries or excerpts of written text. Unfortunately, part of the game's delivery may seem discouraged or, at the very least, uninspired, specifically, in reference to some of Peter's lines in the game. Fortunately, it has more to do with its atmosphere and its reliance on classic survival horror games, which make the game really shine. Some of the ghostly scares presented are certainly decent and, as there is usually only one right way to go, Silver Chains can taste some scares that she knows you will be experiencing. Still, much of the game is firmly on track, wasting the potential opportunity to explore a home and thus giving players some leeway on what they will find and when. The game doesn't do much in terms of new ideas or concepts; however, what it does, it does well, but during my gameplay I couldn't help comparing it with other titles of the same genre. What I mean by that, is that it will probably attract only a niche audience, those who like slower paced games, where seeing is often more important than doing. One of the most attractive aspects for me in games of the genre is the ability to explore and engage with things across the game world. Unfortunately, despite a strong and well-realized scenario, it rarely presents branched paths or optional areas. In fact, most of the game world is static, which means that players can only interact with specific objects, usually those associated with progression. Silver Chains is a game that I recommend to anyone who likes horror and exploration games. The game is best played in short bursts, for a few nights with a good pair of headphones. those looking for a game that revolutionizes the horror genre or offers something new, may be disappointed by their familiarity with existing and well-established horror games.

{"text": "Battlefleet Gothic: Armada. First things first, do I recommend it? Wholeheartedly yes! Now that's out of the way, on to my thoughts about this game. I will be say that I've decided to base my review on the feel and atmosphere of this game, it's faithfulness to the feel of the Warhammer 40k universe, especially with an eye to past 40k games. I won't be reviewing it on the gameplay in depth simply because I do not play enough RTSes to feel qualified to make an assessment either way. Is this game faithful to the 40k universe? Very much so I feel. One of the most striking things personally was listening to the soundtrack, the background music, the dialogue, and finding a welcome familiarity about it. It's as if the people in charge of the music at Tindalos Interactive had sat down to listen to all of Dawn of War II's music and dialogue. Some of those ship captains sound like they could be voiced by the Lord General in DoW2: Retribution. The music, with long mournful organ notes and soaring choral performances, is eerily reminiscent of DoW2: Retribution too. This helps the game feel a strong connection with previous 40k titles from Relic. Set against the backdrop of the 12th Black Crusade, the story thrusts you into a pivotal role in fighting against the various enemies of mankind. The weight of expectations lends a tension to each mission, even though mission types are picked from a standardised set. Despite that you do feel a sense of progression and each battle feels unique. The levelling up of ships and your admiral, and the amount of combinations for ship builds, gives you that additional sense of progression, and the motivation to want to win every single battle. Add in epic clashes involving ships of tremendous infamy such as the Terminus Est, and you feel a firm sense that you're right at the heart of the 12th Black Crusade.  I personally also love the difficulty scaling. I think it's perfect. Easy is just about right for casual players like me, normal is challenging, and hard and heroic are perfect for those who're bored easily if they're not juggling 9 chainsaws on fire. Something for everyone, just the way inclusive gaming should be. Conclusion: for any 40k fan who's been bemoaning the lack of any serious 40k titles over the last few years, this is the answer to your prayers to the God-Emperor/Ruinous Powers/Gork & Mork/Greater Good or whoever it is you pray to... heretic. I would recommend it even at its full price, and I hope that more content is to come. The foundations are there for this to be the big spiritual successor to DoW2, and I hope Tindalos Interactive seizes that opportunity with both hands! ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

I spent quite a bit of time on each one, making them all a little different, and I played with my friends in the privated worlds.  Then the next update comes a bit after the Golden Age, and I see \"Patch R33 Now Live!\" I was pretty excited about this patch, as I already knew it would bring in new things like automation and machines. So I read through it and I saw \"We've been trying to figure out a way to make this game Pay 2 Play er- I mean... Trying to figure out how to fairly charge our players, and we came up with Creativerse Pro!\" Now what I SAW in the actual patch notes was, \"Creativerse Pro players now will get a Glider, a Flashlight, and a bigger inventory.\" I didn't really care about anything except the inventory, that did tick me off a bit when I saw it. However, I could deal with it. What I COULD NOT DEAL WITH is the fact that when I booted up my game, I was restricted from touching any advanced world settings, ESPECIALLY after I was really looking forward to messing around with them because I knew that new settings were introduced in the same R33 patch. However, I still had hope for the game, because I still enjoyed it. What made me simply stop playing this game was when I tried to click \"Create New World\" and a pop-up advertisement shouted in my face, \"BUY CREATIVERSE PRO FOR THIS FEATURE TO UNLOCK!\" At that moment, I lost all hope on the game.

In our right hand: a gun Let's be honest: Post Void is nice, and takes a few tens of minutes from time to time, but its replayability is close to zero. Allow between 1 hour and 2 hours to complete it, after a good hundred runs. Once you understand how it works, you can almost play with your eyes closed. No really need to aim (headshots are taken into account, but the hitboxes are clearly messed up at times and make the game easy), no really need to think, it clears your head, it's funny, and it's very good like that. Little more: a world ranking to compare your scores, it's always nice, except that it doesn't work all the time, too bad! Big minus: The game is clearly made by one person with Game Maker (or something like that, I haven't been verified). It gives an optimized game with the feet (the minimum specs literally made me scream with laughter) On some runs I have had huge slowdowns, mainly when I abuse the shotgun and projectiles that bounce back. It gives the impression of playing in slow motion (or on a Pentium 2, maybe that's the goal? ...) In short: Post Void is falsely retro, it surfs on the \"Hotline Miami\" effect, and everyone cries out genius. For my part, I'm more mixed: it's a nice little game, it's worth its price, but certainly not a positive opinion. You will quickly get bored, buy it more as an experience, and not as a real game.

Usually when we start talking to us about multiverses, I don't know about you, but I find that it doesn't smell good, if not good at all. But you have to give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar and maybe I am an obtuse mind who did not understand the essence of the message conveyed by the developers on the game's homepage: Don't thank me, I sent it to you in its purest version, without frills, without corrected x, y, z errors, or punctuation changes. \"Yeah, but they're Korean, what were you expecting?\" And then the script 'who cares, we talk about the script of Dicey Dungeons? \u00bbYes, but what does your\u00ab N\u00e9overs \u00bblook like? Concretely at a succession of not very successful levels in environments all more generic than the others, we thus have the right to: a postapocalyptic world \u00e0 la Nier Auomata, arenas with Greco-Roman inspiration or even a fight on a square with half-timbered houses in the background to tell us that we are in the medieval world\u2026 It's bland, not very pretty, but it is the justification for mixing universes even if it would have been good tone to have more varieties. On the bestiary side, it's a bit the same thing, we have the right to face enemies of the future in Tron-like suits, heroes and Greco-Roman gods or monsters from pop-culture\u2026 Either way. To recall the principle of the genre, you have a more or less balanced deck where each card requires action points; the cards will allow you to attack, defend or affect bonuses / penalties on yourself or your opponents. You and your opponent take turns depositing the cards you want to play; with a small profit to your advantage, you know in advance the future action of your opponent, so you can adapt your strategy throughout the confrontation. At the end of the latter, you win the famous rewards and in particular cards. These cards will allow you to build a deck with synergies to face the various enemies that dot a dungeon, here the dungeon you will understand, it is the \"Neovers\". We win, we die and we start over by unlocking more and more powerful cards, just like in any good roguelite. Regulars will not be disoriented, the game borrowing some of its mechanics. The cards are numerous, easily identifiable in their function (attack, defense, power\u2026) but not very inspired and ultimately not very readable in their content. You will therefore need time and patience to familiarize yourself with them. In small differences, where we require breaks in the succession of dungeons by visits to the merchant or scenes allowing you to obtain various bonuses, moments of respite which are moreover rather welcome. chooses a \"constant action\", the shop is permanently accessible with a single click and a skills menu \"replaces\" the relics of since your character gains experience for defeated monsters. In addition, missions are offered to you during the fights, missions constituting to play cards in a certain order or to try to reduce the number of points of life of your enemy to reach exactly the value of 0. In order to triumph over the \"neovers\" \u00bb, Three heroines are available, each with several associated decks: Naya, the Japanese schoolgirl of the future in super-tight jumpsuit, Helena who escaped from Soul Calibur and Claire the paladine. You will understand, there is something for everyone: the brunette, the blonde, the redhead. No caricatures among our Korean friends, here, the breasts are boing, boing and the muscles are prominent as well in our young ladies as in your enemies! On the rewards program, spoiler: the outfit in a swimsuit, always very inspired and certainly in good taste, isn't it? One of the problems is precisely the rewards system. There are certainly a few items to buy depending on your victories, but other than \u201cdisguise\u201d and \u201cundress\u201d your avatar, that's about it.

If you are someone who wants that and desires an insanely high skill ceiling then this game is for you.  If you don't care to spend years figuring out how to precisely control your car to have any control, this game is not for you.  I have played for years, but I still mostly suck (despite being ranked in Champion 1) due to not being able to dedicate my life to training. Probably ranked in Champion 1 with little mechanical skill because the IQ of people in this game is awful overall, even in Champion rank.  Players don't rotate, constantly chase the ball, go after boost in the corners instead of defending, etc. Rocket League was much more fun in the early days when there was some map variety.  But instead of allowing people to actually enjoy the game, they dumbed down the maps to be all nearly the exact same.  Game gets worse and worse every year it seems.

{"text": "tl;dr: This is not the right tool for my group/our game. Maybe it is right for you (get unity instead though) I am a new DM and I purchased this tool to see if it was a good fit for a split in-person/online game that I started with my family. Unfortunately I've spent more time trying to figure out how to use this tool than I've spent trying to understand the basics of the game (which is kind of a lot of time already) and it seems to be more cumbersome than is necessary for what I need it for.  Pro: 1. I feel like there is so much included and if you already know what you are doing in your game system (5E for me) you can probably really take advantage of all the hidden bells & whistles.  2. The dice and chat system seem really well done. I love the idea of typing out messages in specific languages and only having the players that understand those languages being able to read them.  Indifferent: 1. All of the official content you want is available and on sale occasionally. For me this doesn't matter as much because I have all of the materials for the campaign I want to run in print already. 2. Most of the features seem like they are pretty well flushed out, but some seem overly complicated or hard to find. IMO most of the features provided can be done easier with pencil and paper... if you trust your remote players. Cons: 1. The price. $40 for a single license (that is on sale occasionally) that does not allow you to host games is crazy to me when there are free alternatives. On top of that you are still going to be spending 50-100% of the price for digital copies of the books. 2. The UI is the opposite of intuitive for me. It took me almost an hour to figure out how to get a map onto the VTT and then have it shared. I've spent a few hours trying to set up my first two sessions and I still do not understand most of the controls related to the map. 3. For the price you get shockingly few tokens. I had to resort to hunting down free 3rd party ones to try to use for pretty much everything... once i figured out how to import maps. There are too many cumbersome features for a new DM and shockingly few resources to actually use in your game (Very few maps/tokens/etc) included in your purchase.

{"text": "This is how you can briefly describe this game. The game really looks like the legendary FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage, but there are a lot of jambs. In appearance the rules and the first couple of hours - you get high and enjoy the game. But over time you see. If you read the whole review, in short: a nasty cheap fake with a bunch of technical problems. In multiplayer, I have not seen more than one player. The bots are quite arrogant. There is very little music and tracks themselves. There is no wheelbarrow balance. Ultimate Carnage> FlatOut 2 >>>>> FlatOut 4> Wreckfest >>>>> FlatOut 3 Didn't play in FlatOut 1. The number of arrows indicates the size of the gap between these games. The most important thing is that the game lags wildly, regardless of the power of the computer !!! I don't know what to call it correctly. Statters, lags, freezes, picture twitching, visual fps sagging, curved effects in the game - choose yourself. Vidos for clarity: My video. Confa: i5 6600, 1660Ti, 16 GB DDR4 Someone else's video, you can see it even better here. Confa: i7 4770k, 1080 ti, 24 GB Ignore the very low bitrate of vidos - it's YouTube that stung them. In the game, these lags are noticeably stronger than in the video. I have 60 fps since the vertical is turned on. If disabled, it will be 120+ fps. But it will be much more laggy, a full slide show. Conducted a survey among friends. For the overwhelming majority, everything is ok here. I tested it on two different monitors / computers: 60 and 75 hertz. Comrades with 144 and 240 hertz - also clearly saw numerous lags. Perhaps, they are not visible on some \"special\" monitors. On both vidos, strong lags are clearly visible in the first minute. If you see them, it means that you will ALWAYS also lag. The first hours will not be very stressful (probably), but then it will bomb specifically. I mean this: This is NOT a production. This is a common thing in every skating rink. The car seems to weigh nothing and takes off into space on any uneven surface. Often these irregularities are not even visible. Multiple turns on level ground are also guaranteed. Moreover, the opponents seem to be magnetized to the ground. They do not take off so much and often. And you are even turned around / thrown into the air after a normal landing from a springboard. If the first point about lags is doubtful and not everyone will see it. Then the problem with physics is clearly evident. It is highly discouraged to accelerate, crash into something, ride on jumps and rails. You fly at full speed with nitro at a standing enemy and ridiculous damage is inflicted on him. In another game it would be a frag at once, but not here. This is NOT FlatOut. In a normal game, there is the concept of \"country\" and this country is divided into several sections. Thus, in one race there will be one section, and in the second race there will be another section that is not similar to the first. Ie it will not be very monotonous. But in this game there is no such thing. There are only return routes. Because of this, it gets very boring because you understand that you were driving the same track literally 20 minutes ago. The tracks themselves are few. One track opens in general in the last cup in star (3rd class) cars. Better late than never huh? If in the first class on derby cars this moment was not very annoying, then already in the second - it was enraged. Moreover, if you started with the \"Flatout\" mode and opened new cars there, then you can immediately buy them for the career mode and ride them right away. No need for standard slow clamshells. Hence it follows - the whole class you will ride ONE and the same car on the same tracks. Fierce monotony i.e. In a normal game, there are two unwritten classes of wheelbarrows: heavy and fast. For example, on a heavy Canyon you won't be able to catch up with Jack Benton's fast yellow Sunray in an easy one. Here, too, they did not give a damn. The best car is the heaviest dump truck with the highest max speed in the game. It almost does not take off on uneven surfaces and drives the fastest. B-balance! In general, the whole career must be driven strictly on heavy cars. Expressways take is equal to suicide. The first bump and you flew into space. There is no one there, not one living soul at all. More than one lobby. When doing cartoon achievements with friends, I ran into a bug. This bug was not immediately apparent. Both friends came to me in the lobby by invitation and could not press more than one button, nothing answered, except for the task manager. Even the beloved Alt F4. Friends went not to one lobby, but to different ones. I had to go through an open search, since there is no one there, no problem. This is the only way to play together. Stunt mode (mini games where you have to throw out the driver). There are old mini-games, though complicated ones. There are also many new ones. Made with high quality. Only here you see the old Flatout. But due to the overestimated complexity, it was not easy here either. Especially in baseball. I sat there for over an hour to make gold. There is pure randomness.

{"text": "As a predecessor to the Fallout series, it is interesting, but I don't think it lives up to modern standards. Or early nineties standards. I tried getting into it, found it exceedingly tedious and decided to watch a good LP of it instead. This one: On the plus side, the Steam version is quite impressive. Despite the fact that it runs on DOSBox and it's not a full-on remake, the devs managed to add: And many more neat touches here and there. If you don't like these new additions, you can turn all of them off. I had no idea you could do something like that with DOSBox! But the game itself doesn't seem particularly well thought out. For example, the only reasonable way to heal after a fight is to wait. You can do that by holding Esc, but you'll be constantly attacked by random enemies appearing out of nowhere (even in towns). The thing is, if you hold   (for  iew) instead, the time will pass and you'll heal up with no enemies interrupting your rest. But in both cases it takes forever even if you use the built-in macro system. So, after each hard fight I ended up pressing F8 (macro for \u2248120   presses in a row) around 10 or 15 times and alt-tabbing out for a few minutes. If I didn't do that, I'd get my butt kicked on the next random encounter. Here's another example: use   on the ground, find a silver vein. Use a pick axe on the ground, loot the ground, get the cash (which doesn't weigh anything, by the way). Now make that into a macro and as long as you hold F10 or whatever, you'll get   money. Jammed the key, went AFK for around 10 minutes, came back to find $20000+ in my pockets. Is this an exploit? I think I was using the   skill exactly as it was intended. It's not my problem that the devs forgot to add code for the silver vein to actually run out. Anyway, what led me to uninstall the game in the end was the fact that the combat was so boring. Most of the time you just press   4 to 6 times, confirm with   and repeat that until the fight is over. And random encounters are so frequent, you can hardly cross a street without getting pounced on by something. I ended up fast forwarding through some fights without reading the combat log in detail, didn't notice one of my characters getting hurt, carried on. By the time I reached the next town the guy was dead dead. And of course the game has already autosaved on it, overwriting the only existing save. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

Really easy to get confused and blink yourself into a wall for insta-death. Really easy to get confused between abilities and blink into insta-death when you actually wanted to reverse shoot. Distracting! Not in a fun 'oo I got to focus I've got this' way. Tons of crap going on both sides of the screen so while you're busy focusing on one side, the other dimension waves its hands at you to grab attention 'oo oo over here look!' Levels are very short.

This is how Crytek wants to deal with high amount of piracy from their first Crysis: \"You're interested in our IP?

This edition of the game somehow manages to have more bugs than the leaked beta test. It controls like the first Crysis, however, your nano suit has been casualized only to carry OP mode, stealth, binoculars which are only used as a waypoint system to find ammo, and nightvision, which is only viable to use in like freaking 3 parts of the whole game. Gotta have something to support that console controller! The checkpoint system WILL drive you nuts. It rarely logs down your progress on your map and just seem to live breathe its own life. If you get a CTD during a map, enjoy being thrown all the way back to the beginning of the map. Avoid this, even if you liked the first game.

But the developers realized that they could not come up with a more successful cash cow than PAYDAY2 and again began to \"support\" it. What began to happen with the game, starting from the year 2017 or even earlier, became a real spit in the faces of those who truly loved it. PAYDAY2 has turned into total chaos. Lots of DLC killing balance and atmosphere. A community of people who received the game for free or for 25 rubles. Logic-defying anti-cheat. A lot of everything. This is no longer a robbery simulator, but a cooperative sandbox. And even the dead game-flash mob under each new DLC was not heard.

I kept reading in reviews how this game makes you feel like a genius like no other game has.  That's right up my alley.  Unfortunately those moments were all too rare in my time with the game.  Even when I did puzzle something together it seemed fairly obvious, and on the flip side of that coin, there were far too many times when I had seemingly exhausted all my options and had to turn to guides for a nudge in the right direction.  Even then, when learning the correct answer and reverse engineering how that conclusion was made, it didn't make a lot of sense.   Far too many times I resorted to plugging random names/fates together in hopes of a match.  And while I did successfully identify several people and their fates in this manner, that does absolutely nothing to make one feel like they actually solved the puzzle, and yet in a few of the guides I read, apparently there is some guesswork expected here, that's part of the design.  I don't think guessing until you're finally right is what a detective game is supposed to be about.  Trial and error is not only boring but it does nothing to make the player feel like their observation and deduction is what made the difference.   I also felt like the grainy, old school graphical style detracted from the game.  This is a game about paying attention to details, and yet details were sometimes hard to make out because of the poor visual fidelity.   The UI was also very un-intuitive.  Flipping between pages of the book never seemed to come natural.  Sometimes Q would take you directly to the table of contents.  Sometimes it did nothing because you have to hit escape first.  Sometimes escape would close the book altogether when you just wanted to close that particular page so that Q would take you to the table of contents.  It's like each button had a different function depending on the particular section of the book you were in.  I'm sure this was user error but flipping through a book shouldn't be too difficult to program so that your buttons perform the same function regardless of your place in the book. The beginning of the game doesn't give much tutorial as to what things do.  For example sometimes when examining a corpse a stream of fog would come out of my compass and lead me to a certain spot on the ship.  I still have no idea why this would happen or what I was supposed to do with it because the game never tells you. In other parts there were seemingly nonsensical solutions.  For example in one scene  the ship is attacked by  All in all I'm disappointed that I bought the game and yet it's too late for a refund.

{"text": "Before going into the details which annoy, here is in a few lines the concept of \"Beyond Eyes\" which, if it had been well exploited, was rather well seen: Technically it is a walking simulator in the 3rd person in which you must help Rae, a little blind girl, to find her cat who has not come home. There is therefore no real interaction with the environment and history (if we can still speak of history ...) is written as you progress. The peculiarity of the game is that you do not have an overview. Like Rae, the landscape is revealed under your feet, like a blank page that gradually emerges. Only a few elements that put your hearing on the alert are perceptible in advance, a few colored scraps lost in the dazzling whiteness of the rest of the scenery still untouched by your exploration. The idea was however simple and beautiful. Even before starting to play and from the first lines of the introduction we understand that the story will be sewn with white thread: the story of a child who loses her sight because of rays of the sun .. At the moment I find the subject a little light, but why not? Let's give it a chance, and then I like children's stories. Perhaps this game could be recommended for the youngest? .. Well no, not even. The story, completely tasteless and dripping with sentimentality, does not serve the purpose. It's hollow and uninteresting. The creators, in need of inspiration, could have used the common thread (the cat) without necessarily trying to tell something, but no, they had to add more. The album \"Martine \u00e0 la plage\" seems to come straight out of a library in the nearby Pl\u00e9iade! Rest assured, there isn't much to read either. Just enough to fill you up in the evening when after 2 hours of walking you discover the end which is just sordid in view of the context. Please understand each other: I appreciate gloomy atmospheres, unexpected or sad endings, this is absolutely not a problem in itself! But there ... it's free, a bit like putting sugar on jam, there really was no need to add misery to misery. : \u26a0\ufe0f SPOIL \u26a0\ufe0f If the character of Rae is particularly slow to move, it remains coherent given the context. But why have she dressed up in a posture giving the impression that in addition to blindness she suffers from mental retardation or even psycho-affective disorders ?! Most of the time, she walks prostrate, bent over, head tilted forward and her arms folded as if her wrists had been tied. She is blind, poor little one, not retarded! Not content with having equipped it for the winter, we add a little phobia to it which, during the ride, quickly becomes particularly annoying: it is afraid of birds. If the slowness of the character is acceptable, the approximation of movements and the management of obstacles is not. The poor kid does not see the walls and the trees until the snitch is inside! As much to say to you that it eats of the pines. Of course, once \"in\" the obstacle and well .. one is in it: sometimes the character disappears completely, the image jumps in zoom, sometimes Rae is found again in the middle of a tree trunk .. it's more than approximate and really very painful because each time you have to get Rae out of his rut \u200b\u200bwith the clear feeling of having to maneuver a 38 tons! \ud83d\udcce In short, you want to discover a game of beauty halfway between watercolor and print?

{"text": "\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 do I went full retarded? Pretty much no, but actually I really enjoy the game. Yes, I mean it, the game its is really fun! No \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, its considered the \"Second Worst Game on Steam\" and hated by almost all critics, which Im not really gonna super defend this game because I have to agree on some stuff. The looting in the game itself is actually pretty fun, scaling from huge varieties of weapons, food, armor protection, backpacks, and such. Zombies are not really that much of intense feel like other triple A title zombie games, so expect some stupid \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to happen. (and bugs...). In terms of PvP and PvE is not really this game main thing, since it mostly feels like \"Shoot first, ask question later\", if you can bare the killing survivors or avoiding them (or purchase your own private server), then you might get through this alive. Since the game is also F2P (but is only trials and you can get that on their site), there also consist of  different type of servers, Public server ( Obviously... ), Trial Server ( for F2P people ), Private Server ( for privater looters or just average host ), Public Test Server ( Test-out for their update on current map or new map ), Stronghold Server ( No announcement on it ) and the Veteran Server ( for players that played it above it 100 Hours ). *Theres another one but its just complete crap. You have litterally 5 Characters creator ( 1 if you are on Trial ), even they die you can pretty much revive them or instant respawn ( with In-game GC). Not much you can really create as you just pick few of the pre-made ones. There is game credit such as regular cash where you can buy stuff from the market, theres GC, which you can pretty just exchange it for cash.... since the whole market uses cash... but what is other purpose of GC you ask? To revive your character and open up private server. Not much to really explain here.  Map itself is not really huge as DayZ but its actually a good scaling, meaning is so huge nor that empty, most of the building is enterable, so you can camp or find a spot to hide. Since DayZ is one time chance of survival and your loot could be gone at that time if you got killed, this game have \"Personel Locker\" (Moving Item placement) and \"Global Inventory\" (your personel item placement), so you can litterally collect and keep your items in it, making it a hassle free to go out and do anything. but it somehow falls really flat due to its huge amount fail on the developer team and support team, trust me, is not even pleasant. Got something missing or stuck? no \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 given. Accidently deleted your character? No one gives a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. Need help on the games, NO. ONE. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. GIVES.  If you are a fan of Totalbiscuit, AngryJoe and other famous reviewers, seen some rant and such, it feels like this is a piece a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, but is not really that huge piece of \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, its playable and enjoyeble with your zombie killing friends and such. Would I recommend this game? Maybe. Should you buy this game over DayZ? Nah. It all depends on you, whether to play it or not. Score = 6/10 ( +Its a zombie mmorpg game, +Habit of looting, +The Feeling of the survival, +Crap tons of weapons, +Vault system to keep all the items you loot, +Fun playing people, -PVP community is abit abused, so be careful first-timer, -No PVE, -Marketplace is expensive, -Horrible support team, -Private servers are costly ) ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "This game hooked me with its idea that you will be in the role of the mayor of the city and wake up not only to build buildings like in a city-planning simulator, but also to solve the issues and problems of the city. This game has it, but it is not fully implemented. Now let's take a closer look at the mechanics and visual parts of the game: - here it is bright, but soapy. The models are all poorly drawn, although I had high-level graphics in the settings. What I liked was the building models, although not very detailed, but beautifully detailed. - I can't say anything. Some people write that the game is not optimized, while others have it. I think it no longer depends on the game, but on the computer, since everything is going perfectly for me. - I would also like to note that the streets of your city will be practically empty, since when you zoom in to the closest distance on the screen, a maximum of 5-10 townspeople and 3-8 carriages will appear. The models are also poorly detailed, the animation of movement is clumsy, and besides, they tend to pass through each other. - the game has little, so after a while of the game you start to get bored of doing the same thing. For example, the game has such functions as decrees, taxes, financing, construction of a district (selection of territory for construction of buildings such as: industry, commerce, housing) and the construction of special buildings (Theater, police, etc.). And for all this, you still need to vote for the city parties, which you can also plead, demand and threaten, so that they vote for your proposals. But even here there are identical replicas. And everything comes to the point that all this is repeated round and round and there is no variety. - Also, what angered me the most, in this case on the Russian interface of the game, the text, that is, the description of certain functions, is very small, which is very inconvenient. The game has just appeared, and it was only created by the campaign of game makers, which is why I want to say that the game came out for the first time with dignity, but it needs to be finalized, otherwise they will forget about it after a while. For example, add new functions in city management. I really liked the idea itself and I hope that the game will not be abandoned and will work on it.

{"text": "Spiral Knights (SK for short) is a massively multiplayer online MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online game) that brings everyone together. It's like creating a virtual world. With a player taking on the role of one in that virtual world It was originally developed by Three Rings Design and then distributed by Sega, later transferred to Gray Havens, a company of the Three Rings former employee group. Let's take care of it all. The gameplay of Spiral Knights is a top-down view from the top, with the essence of being action-adventure. It is said to be similar or comparable to The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures, but SK is 3D, not 2D like Zelda. You can play collaboratively with other people. At the heart of the gameplay will be dabble in dungeons with many kinds of monsters. Various puzzle mechanisms Including traps at various points in the dungeon The game does not have a leveling system for characters. Only full heat will be required to complete the Forge, which will allow you to level up your equipment (weapons, shields, armor), which requires a Fire Crystal for each Forge. At every level up, there are 3 forge levels: low / medium / max. Each level uses a different number of Fire Crystal, the better the level. The more you use the more. Likelihood of Forge success too + Intuitive gameplay There are story quests, daily quests and arcade play, dungeon setting design that looks good, weapons, shields, armor. Various in-game items are very diverse, and versatile abilities. Of all 3 types of pets, dressed up cool and pretty with costumes and accessories, sitting looking for cool items in the Auction House shop, decorating various parts in the guild house, how to fight each boss It came better than expected and the background music is beautiful. All of these are the strengths that make the game so exciting and fun to play - the disadvantages of the game. First of all, the game has been stopping to update anything new for a long time, but only the same events that cycle according to each season, no Asian servers. Of course, if Thai people go for lag, it is definitely easy. But it can be rubbed, but not very good, at present there are no more than 500 players in this game, there are many enemies in the game, but most of them just change the color according to the element. In addition, the attack pattern is the same repeatedly, the PVP is passive, personally I think that going down the dungeon with friends and others is more fun, imbalance of some daily quests. Which is too difficult and the story makes the quest no fun This includes a mid-level Forge imbalance that fails easily despite the 70 - 75% success rate and the disappointing peak of the game +/-. The game is semi-To-Win if not. If you can pay You will have to spend time farming, money, Grinding Farms. So brutal and very boring. Because of having to do things over and over for a very, very, very long period of time before being able to get rich against the person who spay Plus, you may feel lonely at times because people do not already have it. But if you are a person who likes to do things over and over again and have fun and never get bored. You will be able to buy a lot of the stuff currently available in the game in a very short time. The peak of this game From what I have observed It is inevitable that the costumes and accessories are pretty expensive to stand in front of the Auction House shop because there are more people than people building rooms to go down to dungeons. It's really like this. Probably because the gameplay is going around and over and over again, no new updates. I'm not really surprised why I think the pinnacle of this game is to put together expensive costumes and beautiful accessories to stand in front of the Auction House, something that I am very disappointed with at the peak of This game, because it has nothing to do with the core of the gameplay. It's just a small part, but much more outstanding than the main gameplay. The most rewarding point of this game. I think it's about Achievements, because few people can unlock the extremely difficult and 100% Achievements. I recommend playing for fun or for achievement. Just enough, this is enough. If you want to play seriously I think there are many other good games online than this one. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

And don't even get me started on whatever idiot decided it was a good idea to make NITRO BOXES RANDOMLY LEAP INTO THE FREAKING AIR!

{"text": "Let me preface this review by saying I love this game, it has huge potential and it's an improvement on Theme Hospital which is an achievement in of itself, but unfortunately it's currently rife with problems that need fixing as they break the game. I'll happily give a thumbs up as soon as these things are fixed: EDIT: To fix the below issues do the following; Build no; Hand Sanitisers, Plants, Vending Machines, Leaflet distributors, Vendors of any kind, Benches, Ignore Queues of 8 or less (Do not build more GPS), No coffee machines in ANY room but staff room, Do NOT let patients use any toilets. Basically make your hospital completly bland and devoid of anything that makes staff/patients interact with anything other than the rooms. Max out nurses on Wards even if theres more of them than beds, it will counteract the terrible ward AI. It seems a bit ridiculous, but it's the only way to play right now with the AI being written so poorly. And now the list of broken things, which seem to on hindsight be mainly due to pathing / decision issues in the AI. Income Bugged; Income exceeds outcome and game states a profit but lose money every month.  Debt Bugged:  It seems to be that somtimes if you enter Red, even just a little, at the end of the month  instead of the game taking into account income and expenses, it ONLY uses expenses to calculate what your money total is, leading into impossible to get out of downward spirals where instead of losing the for example 20k difference after income you instead lose the entire 90k of expenses with income not used in the calculation at all] GP Offices bugged; Patients don't seem to interact with the offices properly, the queues seem to get longer, so you build more and the queues keep growing. Wards bugged: Stuck patients, nurses don't do anything 75% of the time, instead just walking around whilst the patients wait, hotfix didn't seem to fix this. Training bugged: The game bugs you to train staff constantly, so I did, what happens when you train them with cure increasing traits? The cure rate plumets, dramatically. I was at 80% cure rate with 0 rank doctors and nurses, I train them up to Treatment 1 & 2, cure rate plummets to 30%. Toilets bugged: Toilets in every building? Why bother, the patients often won't use them despite complaining they need the bathroom, I guess 12 stalls per building isn't enough, despite half of them being free of occupents. Drinks/Food bugged: What's that? You built every type of food or drink you can in every building and lowered the prices? Doesn't matter, patients randomly won't use them anyway and then leave because they're hungry and thirsty. Entertainment bugged: Don't bother offering Newsagents, giftshops, Arcade machines or Leaflet stands, they don't get used half the time anyway, patients will then leave because of this. Reception possibly bugged?: Nice big reception? Fully staffed with more than enough staff to rotate, enjoy people just standing infront of the desk unobstructed. Janitors bugged?: Enjoy plants not getting watered, bins not emptied, ghosts not being caught despite having 10 janitors you trained to all have ghost catching. Because it seems 50% of the time they just don't bother doing their jobs. This game is wonderful, but it seems like the longer a hospital goes on for, the more you improve the rooms and the more you train staff it just seems to break, it doesnt matter what job management you do etc etc the staff just seem to stop doing their jobs and stand around. The game should be hard, and is in the right areas, but at the moment it seems like it's just broken. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

It is not just about memorizing the attack patterns of minor enemies or the location of this or that trap that will make you lose all the progress of the level, regardless of the merits you have done until the previous second, but you must also deal with the randomness of the attack patterns of the main enemies (bosses), some pain in the @ss in full rule, and the difficulty curve is geometric as the screens are followed, one after another. There is no sense of progression in your skills or anything like it, you pass the level without knowing what you did well or badly, out of sheer good fortune and that is not fun at all, in fact it is incredibly frustrating, this together with a control deficient that does not respond as it should in a game made to have surgeon precision is undoubtedly the greatest burden that Oniken presents us. I have left it halfway, because I simply do not have the interest to continue playing it, it is a pity because it looks good, but only good looking is not lived, you have to do other merits and those merits are scarce Oniken everywhere. An additional fact, quite worrying. The game executable triggers my PC's virus protection alarms.

The devs state all the basics are in, but if the basics are in I am completely horrified of what it will become if anything.  I made the mistake of ignoring the negative reviews I saw since people said a new patch was out and it was much better since those reviews, I gave that the benefit of the doubt since I've seen that happen before, boy do I wish I had listened to the negative reviews this time around. There is no way I can give this a positive review, there is nothing there, barely even a vision of a game currently.

Coverage mode is well implemented, even with the option to quickly advance from coverage to coverage with a single button. Instinct mode to camouflage a disguise that is not perfect in the eyes of more demanding NPCs. But the rest is deporable. Very idiotic AI with which you can play Tom and Jerry by brushing their backs. The Instinct mode that takes all the fun out of studying your surroundings by showing you the destinations of the guards and the ability to see through walls. The linearity of the missions that make you run through corridors abusing coverage. New features and beautiful graphics don't save the mess that is the rest of the game.

Everything is bad for me in this game, the same radio stations with their music, especially the classics, sound ridiculous in such a game.

The game itself is playable, of course, but I think this is either for fans of GTA-like games, or for those who have nothing to play. Certainly not for kung fu fans. The script is also ridiculous, boring and read in the first 5 hours. You think and hope that they will surprise you, but no.

{"text": "Bad experiment. A failed return to the interactive \"film plays\" of the 90s. Screenwriting peat. Tupy gameplay. We could give such and similar attributes to this game and they are all true. This thing is just as bad as Seagal's films from the last two decades, and calling it a game is an insult to all other games. But okay. The basic premise sounded good to the Japanese Fujinago in his head. Maybe even as a concept on paper it looked ok. But during the implementation, it all simply worked out. I give 10% for a fresh idea to force players to play a completely \"deaf\" game, only with ambient sounds, as if underwater, when the whole first half \"sound\" resembles the Oscar-winning silent film \"The Artist\" (Best Film 2012). The player thus gains the perception of joy-similar to my capital. the inaudible protagonist of Dane (from whom asexuality and transgender fur to one hundred hunts). But even this original approach is debatable. The player doesn't really understand anything on the first pass through the game. Captions are missing, dialogs are not heard. Of course and hl. the hero can probably look away from the lip, so that the complete \"loss\" of the player is in fact unnecessarily exaggerated behind and is a file at the level of a deaf novice-observer. One wonders what really deaf players would say. Well, I think they would also be lost. It will be difficult for the deaf-mute gamer to be able to detect the CGI character from the lip ... The CGI cutscene is about the same as the film with real (average) actors and together they form 2/3 of the three-hour footage (and it is not possible to skip it). In the first part, it feels unbelievably boring and long, because the shortcut doesn't understand anything. The rest of the time is the \"game\", ie something when the player moves between the rooms, where again and again in the same way, manually briefly, thrashes a couple of hulk into the blood (I recommend a gamepad and lower difficulty). At least ten to fifteen shots to each, during which time they will rise from the ground 2 to 3 more times. It is repetitive on the ground, moreover completely non-intuitive. You just randomly combine a fist attack and a kick of the foot, with a maximum of a bend. Nothing more. The camera is scary, so sometimes you hit someone \"blindly\" off the screen. The battle is interspersed with several annoying automatic bullet-time strikes, which just throw you and the camera bluntly. This one doesn't have a torture, where the player guesses what's going on, it takes three hours. Eventually, the strips fold together, but you still feel like you need an explanation. And yes, it really will. With the second passage of the game, ie from the beginning - another three hours - when all the sounds and subtitles are finally full. This style is a bit like French. the game \"Beyond: Two Souls\" from PS4, where the game must also go through again from the beginning. Unfortunately, the satisfaction from a well-written story, which you just \"guessed\" from what is happening on the screen in the deaf part, is not coming. Dialogues and character actions basically don't make sense, it's all unbelievably stupid and confusing, which is amplified by a lot of flashbacks from the past. The author is trying to find a story about revenge, catharsis and orphaned childhood. About a bit of a boy who was shot dead by his mother, who, after years, meets a woman who seems to have fallen out of her eye. She lives in the hands of a gangster, for whom Dane works, and who somewhere in New York settles respect with a competing Dominican gang. But I didn't understand the meaning and message of the whole story from all the sounds. It's just that you The character, many years after the fateful event, within a few hours, only realizes what happened then, is terribly hectic. To this you can add a terrible Czech translation, which is about 1/3 completely out of the bowl. The graphics are also average today and just face-capture characters (paradoxically all but the main one, which looks weird in CGI). The sounds and music do not dazzle and the song by Imogen Heap \"The Quiet\" will not save it in the end (by the way again with a completely stupid lyrics). Achievements in souc. for a while they basically can't be done 100%, because the hardest one (don't get any impact during the whole game) is unrealistic and if someone has it on Steam, then through unlocker (no one has it on PS).

{"text": "At the beginning, it should be noted that the screenshots you see on the store page are from the first release of the game. We can say that the game has nothing to do with those images anymore ... First of all, I am writing this review at the end of a 2000-hour gaming experience. We can say the game of our childhood. For the legend of CS, I have been playing this game series since CS 1.6 and this is the best CS game ever friend. In 1.6, no recoil was better, no, beware of those who say it was better, they can keep talking about this game because they are old-fashioned and it is difficult for them to get used to a new game. Already the recoil system is very similar to 1.6 ... In times of sale - especially when Steam TL support - buy this game and try it. Yes, it will be difficult at first, especially if you are one of those who switched directly from 1.6 to CS: GO, the graphics, animations, etc. it will be difficult to get used to. But when one gets used to it, it becomes addictive. After this trivial introduction, let me tell you the pros and cons of the game: Pros It offers different modes such as Casual Fun, Arms Race (Gun Game itself), Demolition (what was it in Turkish or D). \"Karmaaaa!\" On CS1.6 or CS: S servers. The event mentioned by friends shouting is presented with the rank system and the name Competitive Mode. Moreover, you can also play against foreigners. You put yourself to the real test. It appeals to both 1.6 and Source players as well. Both from Source and from 1.6 easily get used to the game. The point is to get through that short adjustment period. We will learn to be patient, friend :) Weapon skins are falling, boxes are falling. He does not say that you will force open this box. He says open up if you trust your luck. He also makes money by selling them. (I bought Far Cry 3 and Tomb Raider games on my account with the money I earned.) These skins have absolutely no effect on the game, only the image. Believe me - I say 2000 hours of gaming experience - I can't play games with standard skins anymore. Although it is cheap, I get a skin for every weapon :) It offers new maps. With the Community Maps that arrive every 3 months, it offers an opportunity to play an additional 6-7 more maps. Moreover, if you say you are a good map maker, it offers you the opportunity. What can I say about playability, Valve is listening to so many communities that it can even update a map or something that undermines the playability twice a day. Since the game was first released, Turkish and new updates are quickly translated into Turkish. Cons You buy the game cheaply, you earn money from the game, but the game is so addicting that it takes you to buy keys for 5.5 TL to open a box. In summary, it spends a lot of money :) Footnote: If you are stingy, there is no problem for you. Russians and I am sorry to say that some Turks make the man nervous in this game. Do not swear at him like the Russians, and scream out and about. Is it so hard to be human, friend ?! Everywhere fame is attacked, and our Turkish people, when they hear the word Turk, shout at the Russians. Do not be like these bad-tempered nasty ones :) Let the name of the Turk be protected, my beloved ... Yes, you come across cheaters from time to time, especially when you come across a competitor makes your game fun. However, there is one thing that even if you lose the match, the day that cheater ate VAC Ban, your match will be canceled and if you are down, your rank will rise again.

{"text": "When I initially saw this game, I dismissed it as some annoying dungeon crawler that pestered the late 90s and early 2000. I don't really like these games as those tend to feel low budget, tedious and repetitive. When I played the game, I'm surprised to say that this is rather an action-adventure with a story that is a mix between really good stuff and lots of clich\u00e9s.    I call this game an action-adventure rather than an RPG because of the main characters snappy personality, low amount of valid class choices and a low amount of equipment. This isn't bad, its just not what I initially expected. Class wise, there are only one optimal choice, skilling on magic and some on strength to get the minimum number of stats to wield the weapons you find. The reason for that being that the spell system is one of the most complex and well-made systems I have seen so far in any game.  Instead of quick mapping spells or finding them, you instead find runes that you can use to make spells with by drawing these runes onto the screen. Some spells will be told to you, others you have to figure out yourself. This system in theory is really neat but I mostly avoided magic to how tedious it is to always keep drawing those spells over and over again. You can remember/quickslot 3 spells but only for one usage. This means if you want to use a magic missile spell you got to keep drawing them over and over again, most spells having you need to draw 2-3 runes. Ontop of that the recognition, even with fan patch , is one of the most tedious and broken things I've seen. Sometimes you try to draw one spell over 20 times and it still won't work. Other features on the other hand fall flat, combat is dull making you able to do only a light and a heavy attack. Ranged combat is useless and should be ignored mainly due to the game having almost no bows. If you add sneaking/agility/archery atleast the game should try to make it seem like they invested some time in it, otherwise just scrap it. Exploring the map in itself is incredible fun and in contrast to lots of dungeon crawlers, despite the game being solely in caves which I usually despite, this one nailed the exploring part pretty good. Strangely tough, the game introduces you to repairing machinery and smaller hidden switch riddles in the tutorial, but those are never seen again making the game solely a explore, kill and sell items repeat adventure Questing is also strange, I apparently accidently ignored or avoided the main quest, making my way to the last floor on the cave system just to go back to the first because I didn't do some cryptic backtrack to the first area in the game to talk to some person to activate a script thing. Lots of the main quests are rather cryptic. Money also can be almost completely ignored. As soon as the trader opened, I already had enough money to buy myself the best armor with money.   The background story of the game is neat, making some sort of dying earth scenario that I just loved. After playing most of the game is just as clich\u00e9 as it gets, except the main character who has a set personality that is rather fun to listen to.  The ending aswell is satisfying and could potentially teaser for a second game but also in itself is closed which is the kind of ending I like the most.   If you're into good atmospheric tracks and levels this game is definitely for you, especially how every cave feels completely distinct from each other making exploring a complete joy. I loved how they made the oppressing nature and loneliness of a cave clear by yourself making the most noise out there, with the occasional scream or animal running past by.   While I somewhat to a certain extend enjoyed the unique experience the game gave to me I wouldn't really recommend it to other people due to the only thing the game has really going is the exploring, atmosphere and somewhat the story but the rest felt rather underdeveloped especially the combat was, atleast for me, not really fun making it a rather mediocre experience.

{"text": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*  The Walking Dead: Michonne is a fast paced game that covers Michonne's adventures between issues #126 and #139 of the comic book with these three short episodes. Visually, the game looks good, keeping the trademark comic book style that the previous Telltale series employed. Art direction in the menus and intros is particularly well presented, it's really stylish and has some nice nods to the comic. Unfortunately, whilst the overall graphics hold up to previous Walking Dead games, the animation can be a bit weird sometimes. Occasionally the characters move really weird sometimes, which can really ruin the experience you're getting. There are a lot of quick time events in this game, you'll be seeing plenty of them. There's quite a lot of combat, with slow motion scenes to show off Michonne's brutal fighting style. It looks cool but it really doesn't fit well with the realistic vibes the other games pushed.  The real reason why I don't recommend this game is because compared to the other TWD games, this game's story is pretty weak and it doesn't really offer much to the table, and it's here that the game's a letdown. The situations and locations that Michonne finds herself in are nothing we haven't seen before. Caring about these new characters is a real problem. They're all new, and there's a lot of them. There's just not enough time in this short series to invest or care about them much. The main villains, for example, are incredibly boring and generic, though the game does use them to provoke certain reactions, and that's it. The lack of character depth really affects the core of Telltale's games, like difficult life or death decisions. It's hard to feel much tension in these situations when you're dealing with characters you've only just met, and we already know that Michonne survives to continue the story in the comics.  Previous Walking Dead games did a much better job with their characters, because they were originally created for the game. They weren't in the comics so we never knew what would happen to them. It built tension and made your choices more impactful, for you and for other characters as well. With Michonne that's not the case.  For example, there is a choice in the first episode's opening scene where Michonne can pull the trigger or lower the gun. This makes the choice absolute pointless, since I mentioned above, we know Michonne survives in the comics so, what's the point of giving this choice? I guess they just can. And that's not the only problem. Throughout the game, Michonne tries to keep dealing with the loss of her daughters and hallucinates them. As a comic book reader, I appriciated the fact that we get to see the story behind Michonne's daughters mystery, since the comic didn't really focus too much on them. What started as an interesting plot point, turned out to be an annoyance. Her daughter's ghostly figures appear to her in the real world. It's supposed to be creepy but it's not, they even use those creepy child voices and jump scare horror screeches that you've seen a thousand times before. Michonne also experiences playable flashbacks where she's back at start of the zombie outbreak. For example, in the last episode the house is on fire, and you're trying to get out of there as quick as you can. Then Michonne just keep hallucinating her daughters for no reason. Over and over and over again. It gets pretty repetitive and annoying at times, though the last scene between Michonne and her daughters is quite emotional. Like I told you, it started intersting, but these tropes all get old quickly and don't teach us anything new about the character. Although there's sometimes a glimmer of real feeling, the overall approach is so clich\u00e9d and heavy handed it undermines any sense of empathy you should be feeling for her.  So, Walking Dead: Michonne is a medicore game and there's not really anything new here. The gameplay isn't that engaging because the choices don't feel like they matter as much as usual, and it's really disappointing to see no new ideas, especially as Telltale's last series, Tales From the Borderlands, added a bunch of variety. Is it the worst Telltale game? Hell no! (*cough Minecraft Story Mode *cough*) but it leaves a lot to be desired. Newcomers to the Walking Dead games may find this mini-series ok, but fans of the previous series will surely be disappointed with this game, like I did. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

If you're going to move on to a story of infighting, you had to first bring that empire to the most powerful position in the universe and then create a separation of power, applying this across all races led the game to a boring and shallow story. Already with such a weak scenario, they were able to create a story mode of at most 12 hours. Come on, I assume that we have passed this part of the job, we encounter serious problems in the single player mode of the game. Yes, I like some innovations and new combat mechanics, but the giant heroes are officially disregarding the remaining armies of the game. At least it would make more sense if the hero wanted purple crystals again instead of time to extract again when he died. Orcs are weak unless they wear scrap gear, and it is very difficult to raise scrap for the whole army, even half. I feel the obvious superiority of the human race in all the games I play. Artificial intelligence is officially massacre. If I say your partner is useless. If you are thinking about buying this game seriously, get it if you have a like-minded friend. Because there is a possibility only that you can really taste it. The Turkish patch of the game was perfect. Congratulations to the team who prepared this patch. I found the graphics, music and voices successful, but as I said, I could not really get a taste of the game. Finally, I want to quote a sentence from gorgutz: -Hey, kids, are you ready to fight with giants? We will rewrite history today. Do you know what I mean? (Gorgutz) -Does it mean that we all will die just to be stronger than all of us? (Wazmakka) -ee yeah. (Gorgutz) 5/10 (unfortunately I can't recommend it) ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Well, the tiny MP community that the game does have, are actually \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665... The game has this ridiculous way to \"save your cash\" in stashes but if you get killed and go and pick it up and someone sees you, theyll just blow you up to take ur \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. The vehicles are super lame, the mecanics are ok, but they are bland and it's not explained how they are mustered and why. More or less, here more troops, more vehicles, go shoot! And the shooting is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 endless. Coop or single player is basically endless horde mode. Taking a single objective takes numerous hours as the enemy just throws endless waved of soldiers at you (sometimes this anti-climactically takes secons, like 3 almost empty bases in a row). They AI not particularly \"bright\" but not too bad. They take cover when shot at, take rooftops, try to flank, but have weird quirks like lumping behind a rock or swimming beneath the docs for no apparent reason. But the machine gun fire is constantly mowing them down and they never stop... Its ANNOYING AS \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, because it can only be fun for so many hours as you are trying to take A SINGLE OBJECTIVE doing the exact same thing.  The little items you get as loot occasionally, that you can sell for cash, is a broken system that gets abused by people who just buy shields and run around picking up all the loot. If you are a sniper, or focused on actually winnning the battle, good luck making money off the battle, more than likely for your efforts you will be killed by the enemy and then if that happens enough times, your resources are 0 and you cant affort to arm yourself with anything other than a basic rifle, while every tool is running around with a shield and full armor, swimming in cash... (its not like that all the time, but i've seen it more than once)  Also Im not sure about this, but there is no way to \"unlock\" new guns that arent standard stock. You can find them and i guess trade them, but if you die or some douchebag thinks he wants your gun he'll just rpg you... Well, thats that. If i'm wrong, someone correct me Overall, the game is fun, I had about 2 days of fun with it, but at the current stage, I feel like that is all it can offer 99% of players. There's just not that much here, besides a robust foundation. There are maybe 30-50 people that are not part of that majority. More development and balancing, ability to pick maps, actual PVP, a tutorial (after all this time i still feel like im missing like 70% of data) and maybe some \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 character customization, and i wouldnt mind actually playing this with my friends.

{"text": "I was very much looking forward to the latest instalment in the series which is Total War Rome II. Sadly the game disappoints, this might be my own fault for not looking more closely to gameplay videos but mostly it is the developers. From the first game till Shogun Total War 2 the game just kept getting better, and that's because they kept just tweaking it a little. The graphics also kept increasing to further heights which made watchin the battles close-up immensly fun. Now to the harder part. I have to be honest and say I've only spent a few minutes in the game and even less in a battle, and the reason for this, is that the game infuriates me to such degrees that I couldnt keep playing. First off is the horrible, horrible UI, I've never been so annoyed in my life. The last games were easy to navigate and control. Everything from your armies to your cities. Suddenly instead of having an overview of the map the screen is just crammed with smaller windows with ugly pictures of your general and HUGE unit icons. Then theres the city management which they screwed up big time. Instead of having cities in provinces, you know have provinces with cities. This might sound like a good idea, but when your enemy or other AI, can have a few cities in the province, then you start becoming really confused. Furthermore the building options have been extremely limited of what I can see. Again, I have not played for very long, so it might get better later on, but still the UI is terrible, and in a game, where MANAGEMENT is a key gameplay element, you just can't have a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 UI like the one in this game. Why couldnt you just have kept the simple nice UI from Shogun 2? Instead you fill up half the screen with crappy windows so I can't see the bloody map properly, and you can't even zoom out that far - How the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 am I supposed to manage an empire like that?! Now that's out of the way, let's continue to the most disappointing feature in the game. The combat. Again it's the UI that lets the whole thing down. In Shogun 2 you had 3 simple features to look after. Minimap, Unit Management and Unit List. It was so nice and simple. In this Rome II abomination you have the same 3 features only they've scaled up the Unit List and and removed the unit management from the lefthand bottom corner to under the unit list. So you have this big mother \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 box filling up the screen where the fighting is happening. Then theres a useless picture of the general or whatever bastard you got controlled in the lefthand bottom corner. In the olden games, you atleast had the nice army control button. I remember them fondly from Shogun 2, so when you had your whole army selected you could move them forward, whilst they stayed in formation. Where are these controls now?! I couldnt find the bastard things and tried moving the whole army forwards, which resulted in just a long line of crap. The minimap they also placed down in the bottom line, just in the righthand corner. WHY DID YOU DO THIS? Now there's a huge line of windows in the bottom of your screen, which is also where all the fighting and unit movement goes on. Why not move some of does \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 windows up in the tophand corners in the sky. I'm interested in the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 battle with swords and death and blood, not a load of UI windows! Furthermore that bloody unitlist and the new unit icons is bloody awful. It's the most simple thing I have ever seen, I can't understand they wanted to do the whole Roman/Greek culture with tile/marble kind of style, but the units look so bloody similar I cant see the difference between a general and a standard unit. Worst of all the unit-icons are so large, and you can't minimise the entire window, without being handicapped during the battle. This review isnt totally fair to the game, seeing as I've been playing it for a few minutes. You might actually like some of the changes, but if you are like me, and loved the previous games, and the feel of them - You're gonna be disappointed ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "The game is not bad. But IMHO does not justify its price. In the beginning, everything is very cool, atmospheric, decent soundtrack, normal cars, relaxed control. But after 5-6 hours everything disappears. It seems that the game has a lot of things, a huge map, 5 classes, a bunch of side quests \"find and collect\", pumping skills and cars. But in fact, everything turns out to be very monotonous. The main thesis is quantity, not quality. And as a result, after a couple of hours of playing, there is a feeling as if I went to work. There is very little fan. However, a negative assessment from me - because of the disposability of the game and the excessive greed of the publisher. Plot missions can be replayed as many times as you like, but to start absolutely from scratch, with an untouched face-down map - it's impossible in principle, there is simply no \"New Game\" item in the menu! The vehicle fleet in the game is ambiguous. On the one hand, there are no unnecessary Lokhov initial cars here, you start the game right away with good cars. In principle, one car is enough for the entire game, just add new classes to it as you progress and that's it. But there are not many cars in the game, but if you want more, buy the Season Pass - it costs like the game itself. And now you can still buy some cars separately for 99-199 rubles. Very rude, in my opinion. Valve takes money out of players' wallets much more gracefully. As a result, almost the only interesting mode is PVP competitions, classic competitions with other players.

{"text": "i have only played this game for about fifteen minutes, but a quarter of an hour is all it will take for you to have seen everything this game has to offer. As you might have guessed from the screenshots, this is pretty much a Flash game. It may not be coded in Flash, but it is very much of the low-quality that one might expect from any of the thousands of free-to-play, web-based, simple mouse + keyboard games found on sites like NewGrounds. Which brings us to the first problem with this game. It really should be controllable with a standard twin-stick controller, which it is not. Using the steam controller is relatively painless, once you have managed to get the damned thing set-up properly which brings us to issues number two and three. This game really does not like you reconfiguring the Steam Controller while it is running. I managed to set up a working configuration, but I had to reset my machine a couple of times in the process as changing the config. caused my Steam Machine to get stuck on the configuration editor screen. And the game is just really poorly coded in general, really amateurish in almost every aspect, even for a gag-game. How a game of this quality makes it to the Steam Store is a mystery. Except when one considers the marketing value of using a well known meme as your premise. So if this is some kind of cynical marketing excercise by valve then \"Boo Valve!\" Which brings us to my more subjective criticisms of this game. Being meme-based is not necessarily a bad thing in itself, but this game gives me the distinct impression that the author spent about as much time working on this game as one might typically spend on producing one of the simple comic strip images which this game is based on. I would be surprised and a little disappointed if the author spent any longer than 15 minutes to half an hour working on this. That kind of production quality might be fine for what basically amounts to free content on a social media platform, and might be a laugh if played for free on the afore mentioned website NewGrounds. But this is Steam, and even for two US quarters this games is overpriced by at least 100% . Even if you have several gigabytes of rage meme images on your hard-disk I might still advise against purchasing this game, the only enjoyment I see myself getting out of this game is the small amount of joy I get from identifying bugs and then laying the boot into a poor game. 2.5 out of 10 ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

Well, if it's simple, somewhere in a distant galaxy, little robots are fighting between each other for candy, and thanks to magic paper clips, these robots improve their armor and other parts of their body. Karochi, no fantasy. Moving on to the gameplay. Gameplay. Here the developer took all the best from different games (Quake 3, they even took a copy of one map, I say, there is no imagination to come up with something of their own.) And something like that happened. You kill robots, you win, you get paper clips. You can kill with different guns. But most of the guns you will use and take only to complete achievements. There are several game modes that are typical of other games in this genre. There was no more strength left to come up with something of my own. Balance and earnings in the game. This is where the developers show their alternative side of their greed. In order to upgrade your character, you will have to enter the game every day so as not to lose the bonus, complete achievements and increase the level. All. That's all the earnings, and in order to pump up to maximum armor, you will have to invest in the game. I figured it out for a long time, it comes out about 10,000 rubles. Where will a student get so much money? That's right, he will take from his parents, who have long wanted to get rid of their annoying son. It was even earlier, they introduced GOLDEN STAPLES. Well, this is when there is no time to play and get into the big league, but there is 100 rubles, which I have been saving up and saving for school lunches for a whole month. Therefore, it is up to you to decide: either invest in a game to get into a cool super-duper clan and all the children were afraid of you, or to shoot robots heads off all day and night. Moving on to the graph. Grafon. Oooh, the developers did a great job. Turning on the Ultra-grafon mode, your game will stop working, unless, of course, you have an expensive computer. Therefore, all the boys play at the minimum salary, but if you want brightness, just increase the brightness on the screen, and not change the graphics settings. And so the graphics are made in children's styles. Features of the game. Hmm ... well, yes, there are game modes, opportunities to complete achievements, a large selection of paints, leagues, exclusive items, grenades, 3 classes of robots. But all this did not exist before and was well played without it. And what is all this for then? I will answer you - so that with \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you can spend the cherished 100 rubles, as Likhova likes to do it. Let's summarize the results. We have a game that is ready to give you all the delights of the game for money, or for a long period of the game. Over time, you will get tired of the monotony of the game. The only thing that saves the game is tournaments and KV, which the players arrange among themselves. So schoolchildren from all over the country find out who is the coolest gold cap.

{"text": "*Rant of a jaded old fart incoming who clearly forgot how to have fun* I like to imagine a Bethesda board meeting where they were going \"I don't know, there has to be a way to waste even more of the player's time\". Do you like smithing 2,000 Gold Rings to get your smithing skill up? Do you enjoy killing trivial enemies over and over to fill your sould gems for enchanting? Does the mere thought of running mindless errands and doing uninspired fetch quests cause you to just cream your pants? Do you sometimes think \"Man, I wish this game was even grindier\"? Then by golly is this the DLC for you! First things first: Hearthfire lets you build a house. So far so good. Now you can have a house in every hold except Winterhold, which is, apart from the Mage's College, mostly a deserted eyesore anyway. You start off with building a Small house that you can then augment with a main hall. Once you've done that you can build up to three wings on your house where you have a choice of three options for each. East Wing can be an Armory, Kitchen or Library, North Wing can be made into a Trophy Room, Storage Room or Alchemy Laboratory, while for the West Wing you have the choice between Bedrooms, Greenhouse and Enchanter's Tower. You want a house with Library, Kitchen and Bedrooms? Game says \"No, go \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 yourself!\". And that's where customisation ends, as will become evident. To build the different parts you have to select them at the drafting table and then click on the different stages at the carpenter's workbench, while having the required resources in your inventory. Resources mainly consist of Iron parts (fittings, hinges, nails), lumber, clay and quarried stone, with added corundum for door locks for whatever reason.  Now the building becomes a glorified game of \"click all the options\" at the workbench and a mindless grind for resources. You go to the different towns, buy every Iron Ingot you can come across, forge them into nails, visit the lumber mill for wood where the vendor uses the same generic line over and over \"Doing some building, eh? I'll have them hauled over right away!\", wait for your character to mine clay and stone, go back to workbench, click click click, oh no more nails left, forge more nails, click click click, back to the lumber mill, and to town because you ran out of iron, click click, oh damn I forgot to buy corundum, click click forge more nails click click and forge some more bloody nails. With each click you add a new component of the part you're building, foundation, walls, door, roofing, etc. Since there's no actual building this isn't fun in the slightest. I suppose you're meant to build a few parts when you can between adventures and see your house slowly grow over time. Experience teaches us that that is not what gamers do, though. Now to the interior design. Each part can of course be furnished, which again needs resources, some of which like glass are quite hard to come by (because of course they are. Wouldn't be Skyrim if you didn't have to suffer for your accomplishments). For every piece of furniture you have two options: Build and don't build. You cannot choose where to put the bed, you especially cannot choose between different kinds of beds, you can just choose to either have a bed or not have a bed. Either have a shelf there or stare at a blank wall. Maybe it's for the best, since customisable placement would probably be too much for the game's physics engine to handle. An engine that to this day doesn't allow you to place objects into display cases unlesss you want said items to spawn outside of the case the next time you enter your home. Luckily you can hire a steward and pay him or her a stipend to furnish the different parts for you over time. I certainly couldn't be arse at that point anymore. Then you can finally move in with your spouse, who will then \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 about how unsafe this region is. Fun. Also you can adopt children with this DLC. Whatever, there's little to no depth to that. Also this DLC will unlock more mindless busywork pertaining to your home such as a Giant's attack oder a Skeever infestation. Not exactly fun, but maybe something to count down the hours till you die. One little positive thing I have to add is that the houses you build are vastly superior to every house you can buy in the vanilla game. That's not saying much, though. TL;DR: Hearthfire is not the Sims in Skyrim experience people have lauded it as. Different layouts? No. Different styles of wallpaper or furniture maybe? Nope. Different placement options for items? \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 no! You get one thing and you will like it because we're Bethesda and we don't care. I've harped on Skyrim a lot and the #1 defense I always get from fanboys is \"Just install mods it fixes everything\". And for once I have to agree. There's probably a mod out there that gives you the house building experience you were looking for. So get that instead of this insult of a DLC. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "This game is one of the most beautiful games I've seen; the mix of a Lovecraftian aesthetic with the beautiful, hand-drawn visuals of Jotun is something that is undoubtedly pleasing to the eye. Also, I didn't find the controls near as bad as a lot of people say they were. I found them intuitive, having lots of variety to ways to combo things together, and being smooth and well-thought out. However, that's where the good things end. Despite looking & feeling wonderful to play, the actual areas you'll be playing through have some of the most backward design you have EVER seen. enemies show up in droves wherever you go, sometimes even spawning endlessly. There were points where there was an enemy with a ranged attack off-screen, and when I went to the spot they were at to fight them, another would immediately spawn where I JUST was, off-screen, turning the fight into nothing more then the most tedious back and forth. There were points where, while trying to do a tense jumping puzzle, the game would just spawn enemies that weren't even native to the area I was in, endlessly, making it a chore to even attempt the puzzle. This is 100% a wonderful game to watch someone play, but a nightmare to play itself. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "\"\" (HF Lovecraft,) And a hellish abyss opened up before me. And with my own eyes I saw in the womb of her unfortunate souls a host of chattering teeth in the kingdom of darkness, amid endless torment. And I am the name of the satanic rookery, about which I will indulge in terrible revelations. The dungeon swam in the blood of innocent victims under, which spirit does not rest ... Hm, what? What kind of \"The Agony\" ?! At one time, your humble servant was sincerely imbued with, thanks to which he condescended to the mediocre. It is possible that in a metaphorical sense \"The Agony\" became for me a punishment for carelessness. And therefore, remembering, I regretfully accept a simple but obvious truth: a miracle did not happen ... It could not have been by definition. Focusing on three-dimensional projects, she did not pay any attention to the shortcomings of the ryona-predecessor and additions to it, ignored the advantages of competitors and ultimately released from perhaps the weakest (before the release of another \"domestic\" novel) visual novel of June. No, no one expected a \"killer\", but on the past merits of the previous studio game (colorful characters, mate, light eroticism, curious setting, the presence of a choice influencing the plot, and attempts to moral relativism and even psychologism) will not go far, especially, when literally everything pulls the game to the bottom of the catacombs ... The list of unambiguous claims opens with intrusive ones tormenting the keyboard - surprisingly the lesser of evils. Nagging about art and music is a matter of personal preference. Regarding the first, the updated design of the sprites frankly cut my eyes, which partially, in fairness, showed itself not from the best side back in \"The Eighty Kilometer\". However, the processed photographs and \"one and a half\" original art also do not make the weather. As for the second, the soundtrack selected from free libraries, traditionally stored in a folder in good quality, seemed rather monotonous and faded with rare exceptions in the face. However, all this pales against the background of the mediocrity of the story itself, of which the duration, which was understated in comparison with the \"Sixtieth Kilometer\", was only beneficial. I think that within the framework of the visual novel genre, you can build an interesting frightening story that is in no way inferior and no one will argue. After all, the cult mystical ryonai genre is full of doujinshi to opulent. But, of course, not every scary story is given to tickle the nerves of its readers, as well as to interest them with a curious intrigue. The Novella by M. Kalinichenko and K. Shcherbakova is a clich\u00e9d domestic horror film, with a slight touch of Lovecraftianism, suffering from a disease. The silent underside, if you will. Errors in the text and logical inconsistencies are the tip of the iceberg. For example, boring extra-ordinary characters can be forgiven, you can ignore the fact that the topic in the ryonai is not disclosed in any way, and awkward attempts to talk with the reader about political and economic crimes of the last decade of the last century by the authorities holding compatriots, like other hints about at least some depth, they break off mid-sentence ... Yes, even a miserable parody of battles \u00e0 la, emphasizing this similarity with a composition, one could forget with the guests, like a bad dream! So after all, as luck would have it, the story itself is written so extensively as it is artless. The novella is spoiled by a syndrome - it is simply not interesting to read ... Without being seven inches in the forehead, your humble obedient servant does not hide his lack of writing talent, but it is one thing to write recommendations in and quite another to trade in expired graphomania. The story of the missing miners hiding in the catacombs could have been turned into good fiction, a mystical thriller, or a social drama, but the result was only a soap opera with an admixture of trash. There are also several interesting puzzles in the game, the solution of which is a prerequisite for opening the most interesting versions of the ending of the story, but that is a dying ray of light in the dark kingdom. On the other hand, the former creators, judging by the price dropped since the release, are well aware of what exactly they have released. Well, in this case, the best domestic horror movie of the year, as it was, remains free, and the next gaijin trash gets a point corresponding to its essence. In fact, agony is a story about how he finally left, and showed your humble fig. P. S. Happy Halloween, my reader. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

I can't spoil the story just yet since the game just came out and I don't want to ruin it for the others. If I had to mention about the story, you would be more or less disappointed. The reason why I gave this game a negative review is because it was sort-of repetitive exploration and eventually starting to bore me. What it gave me was: Flashbacks after Flashbacks, Tunnels after Tunnels, Corridors after Corridors, Caves after Caves, you get it. The puzzles were done too easy that I figured them out in just few seconds. The new \"struggle\" mechanic after losing your mind in the dark was more of a nuisance than a dangerous situation. Inventory was being very limited, preventing you to take more oil canisters/matches. Unskippable cutscenes. Also one lost mind can cause cheap jumpscares to you (flashing pictures and noise). And few other minor bugs. One or two things I liked about this game was the atmosphere and the new addition to the matches. The matches allows you to light up multiple light sources (like lanterns, torches or candles) with only one match and use it as a small light source. Pretty handy, but like I said earlier, the inventory space ruins it. Being able to hold 10 matches at once isn't really great considering how quick they can ran out which ruins my immersion with this game. The atmosphere in the other hand is great. The skies were pretty in the deserts, the caves look terrifying, ambient noise all over the places. Monsters growling. These things kept me back when I was playing TDD in 2012. Good times. Overall, the game isn't good or great for me. Other people might share their different opinions, but me, I am just disappointed with this game.

{"text": "Dude this is a goddamn card game! But there is something that makes it different from the others. So what is this conversation? -The cards we throw are 3D animated and live competition. Yes, the only joke is that disperse ... Anyway, let's say the gameplay part of the game or the learning part. First of all, we have a bridged field that connects mutually and we can throw our card at any point in this field. These cards are divided into spell and character cards. We can throw Spell cards instead of \"including the opposite tower\", but we can only throw the character cards at a point we want in our own bridge area. After throwing our card, it moves towards the opposite bridge and attacks the opponents who enter the attack area, which if it does not die, continues to go. When he comes to the tower, he hits the other team's tower. Tower main characters also attack this card. Each card you throw has its own unique ability. At the same time, these cards are divided into space and air. If you didn't throw a card that could hit the air or go up in the air. As they continue to attack your character, the card you throw just keeps moving forward. We set up decks for ourselves and enter the game with this deck. We can use the cards our deck has. Of course, the Masters, our main characters, also have their own abilities. So what you have to do in the game is to know what to throw at which card! You have to throw the right card in the right place and remember that your deck comes randomly. You cannot start with the same card in every match. You will see 4 cards and these 4 cards are given to use in a random shuffle form in each game. In addition, if your opponent's deck is more dominant than your deck, you can play strategically and maybe flip the match, but it will force you. In other words, both luck, knowledge and strategy are required (To achieve success in the game). Once you know them and get used to the game, it's easy to play strategically. The game is not bad yes, but the player base is not nice. Most of them do not know the game and no matter what your league is, especially in team matches, someone who does not know the game can come to you. It's too much ... Also, there are optimization problems and abidic gubidik game kicking bugs in the game. If you drop out of the match because of the bug, don't worry. Because the game makes you lose the match by saying why did you come out with the horse head and as a result you may fall in the league. This problem has been fixed, I think if you fall from the match, you can continue the current game if you can connect back quickly, but your tower will be damaged or exploded until you enter. Anyway, if I will touch on this terrible player group of the game for the last time, I would like to share a few lines of the words I wrote in a very rageful situation in my first review. A few of them in ahan; - I have not been able to figure out why this game, which has a brain as much as a nut, comes to this game, which is a strategy game that is a slow game card game. We are playing GrandMaster League in the game, the man who came to my team does not know what card to throw. What does this mean? If you can play the game, you will carry it almost completely in the team match, but sometimes there will be so many good guys that you will not even be able to support the man no matter what you do. It is really a game that should not be played and the battle pass event, so when this season is over, I permanently delete it. Don't play, don't play, I'm trying hard not to get an archer tower right now. Don't bother yourself by increasing your nervous stress level. Yes ... I don't know if anyone has ever read it, but what should we say, the decision is your friends. If you say I play boredom without worrying, it is a game you can spend time but don't stress yourself.

{"text": "One of the most anticipated games of the year. It has been in development for 6 years. And what did you get in the end? A ruined masterpiece. Cons: 1.Plot: went to fight, returned as a different person. They killed those close to him - he went to take revenge, smashing and killing half of the city along the way. About the character, behavior, charisma, intelligence of the protagonist, I generally keep quiet, damn it. 2. Terribly monotonous missions that only bring boredom. All tasks from the section \"come there - kill that\". And nothing more. After three hours, the game becomes terribly boring. There is nothing left of the real mafia here. This is more like a godfather. 3. One feels that the game is damp. The number of bugs is just off scale. And the hero keeps getting stuck in the textures. And a car with ammunition generally has the ability to stop anywhere, whether at least in the middle of the road. 4. Perhaps the main disadvantage is the mediocre graphics. No, I'm not at all a person who only plays games with perfect graphics and always comes to the stones in games and digs, they say, \"Why are there so few pixels?\" Simply, the very fact that the graphics have remained unchanged since the days of Mafia 2 makes me really unhappy. And in some places it became even worse. Yes, in that game, it was gorgeous and even now looks very cute, but for such a long time the developers had to create something amazing. Games about Drake and Lara Croft simply erase Lincoln Clay into powder. 5. Artificial intelligence. The guys are in the yard in 2016, after all. It should be very embarrassing for such a misunderstanding. Lincoln, crouching down, goes to several victims at once, and being literally a meter away from them, in three seconds manages to kill them all, and they did not even understand what happened. Well, what is this? And then there is the police, which often do not care if you violate traffic rules or not. 6. Machine control was spoiled by adding a navigator. For example, I don\u2019t want to go along the arrows, but I like to lay the route myself, whatever I want. 7. But this is a complaint to our legalizers. Terrible subtitles. Not only are they small, they are also shown in a solid block a few frames before. Change 4 or 5 pictures, but the subtitles do not change. I personally would like the information to come as the characters pronounce the words. Yes, they didn't even translate the news on the radio, the simplest thing, well 8. I'll just say that a lot of chips were licked off from GTA, Assassin's Creed, Watch Dogs. 9. Small settings menu, spoiled brutality and charisma of Vito, it feels like it's not him, but his clone and much, much more. All the disadvantages cannot be enumerated. And money scattered everywhere, even on the toilet cistern, causes nothing but tears of laughter. I could close my eyes to many bloopers if at least something was done perfectly in the game. But alas. Is that the very atmosphere of the game, and even then it is somehow full of holes. You can play, of course, the game, but the pleasure, as from the previous parts, will clearly not be. It's so easy to kill time and that's it. I recommend it only out of respect for the line of games itself. Mafia 3 should definitely be nominated for Disappointment of the Year. I was waiting for this game the most, I liked the mafia first and even more, I was just delighted, mafia 2. I expected a great continuation of the story of Vito and Joe, but I got this ...

Then you wait like 3 minutes for another plane to mask the sound of the next shoot, well the target got behind a wall, cool 3 more minutes waiting for the next plane.

This is a fun little game I now want to buy so that I can keep it on a table somewhere to idle away 10 minutes with someone if I so wish.  The board game itself is great. In short: You buy one of 3 queued pieces of fabric, place them on a grid to make a quilt, with as few empty spots as possible. You pay for these pieces by both \"buttons\" you get from some pieces and \"moves\" you have to make on a timeline track- most of the time, you don't want to progress too quickly, so it's a fun balance. When both players reach the end of the timeline, you tally scores (buttons, filled/empty quilt squares, a bonus) and see who wins! It's great, simple fun with an approachable and creative theme that pushes some of the same buttons (ha) as Tetris.  ... So why do I not recommend it? Well, I do not recommend it *without reservations*.  This port is clearly a low-effort port of the iOS/Android versions of the game. Here's how I know: 1. The text scaling in menus is clearly intended for a small screen (i.e. phones). They're way too large on a computer screen. 2. The loading screen when you first boot up the screen says \"Tap to continue\". Tapping, for a PC game. There are also some bugs. A few are graphic glitches (when you click on a tapestry you can sometimes still drag around the fabric queue which makes their tags show up above the tapestry still in focus), and some are gameplay-related (sometimes the game doesn't let me interact with a patch I should be able to buy and I have to quit the session and reload from the main menu).  A few odds and ends are also unsatisfying (for example, the number of buttons owned by each player are written in a featureless, ordinary font, even though the rest of the game uses a custom font, including for numbers), but they're not a big deal. The art is nice and the music is surprisingly great- it's very relaxing! TL;DR: It's not a very polished port, and I cannot recommend it without reservations, but it's fun regardless.

I am able to run it for what that's worth, but the controller support is still lacking. Also the devs really (from what I have seen others might have a different response) don't seem to think they need to fix anything. I have seen post by devs where they basically blamed the users (not flat out implied) for buying a game their system can't run. But that's the thing a lot of these systems should be able to run it and it just doesn't work. If you have a really good DX11 computer and feel like rolling the dice be my guest, but I say wait and see if the devs actually release any updates. Hasn't been one for at least a few months and the game only came out in April I think there was one in May. Update: It really falls short on gameplay there are many other survival horror games that do a much better job at suspense. It has an orginal idea, but it's not enough to break off from games like Slender, Amnesia, and Outlast. A lot of the scary stuff has literally been used in these other games and the effect is just getting tiresome.  There are lots of complaints from users about lag. Threads with hundreds of posts, and then you have to listen to people tell you that your computer is not really DX11 and you don't really know what you are doing.  Even if you getting running without lag chances are you are not going to play it that much, after all it is just walking down halls the whole time.

When the game was first released in beta, possible problems were ignored. Most of the weekly and monthly updates were getting performance and bug fixes. However, over time, the company started to ignore users' problems and instead of existing problems, as in H1Z1, it started to update areas such as cosmetics (which it thinks it makes more money) etc. Incorrect choices made, unmanageable community and ignored player (customer requests) behaviors. In conclusion, a game with more than 3M instant players lost more than 50% of this audience. This collapse seems to continue.

{"text": "I. An uncompelling and bland attempt at recreating a legendary game, visibly following the modern action RPG tendencies. There is a multitude of issues with it like the technical flaws, and the apparent 'reimagining' of the story and atmosphere, which will undoubtedly face lots of reproach from the fans. Yet, there is way more to it. The very attitude toward this game's development feels horribly off judging by what I have experienced. Surely, it is important to cater to the general playerbase that exists today, but there is already enough games that do that, not to mention that they will inevitably be ahead in terms of graphics, combat, story - you name it. With this approach, the game is doomed to blend with other generic RPGs we already have - hardly contributing anything to the longevity of Gothic series. Then, what can be done about it? Gothic does deserve a remake, but it should be mainly focused on meticulously bringing back the experience the original game had. Yes, there is plenty room for adjustments, but nothing should be changed SO drastically. Gothic had unique controls and combat system, which should be actually preserved to some extent. A good way would be sticking to Gothic 2, where controls were actually rather intuitive, no longer requiring at least 2 inputs for most of the actions.  The gameplay should also be as close to the original game as possible. That includes the game balance, the equipment and its impact on player's abilities, the magic system, to name just a few. All these features are vital for the game, for they comprise a considerable portion of the Gothic experience. Without them, it will end up being a mere travesty, just a boring imitation of the masterpiece that is Gothic.  Same goes for the atmosphere, the graphics, the music and everything else. Thankfully, Gothic has seen an incredible amount of improvement. Not only by the developers themselves, but also by the fans, who are to this day interested in the Gothic series. There are numerous mods that improve and expand the original experience, and many are still being made. However, everything has its limits, and there is only so much one can improve in some of the game aspects, mostly due to the game engine limitations. However, an actual developer should have more power to accomplish such things. This might be asking too much, but it is what the game truly needs. II. Pros: \u2022The possibility of a remake itself, as well as the possibility of the issues getting fixed. \u2022Territorial expansion is nice, and some of the areas look very authentic, like the Old camp. \u2022Apparent restoration of the cut content, like feeding animals and stuff, since there is a lot of unfinished things in the original game. Generally, this is a good direction for change. \u2022Graphics. Although it is a questionable one. Graphics play a significant role in building up the atmosphere, which is a key feature for Gothic, therefore it should be treated carefully. \u2022Controller support. Cons: \u2022Combat system. Although it does have a vibe of the original one, it should be even more so, in order to keep the one-of-a-kind feeling it once had. \u2022Equipment. Hopefully, the current armor models are just placeholders, they look completely different from the original now, while it should be the other way around. The weapons should also look realistic, since that was an important feature in Gothic. No thick blades, gigantic cross guards - that kind of stuff. \u2022Balance. Should stick closer to the original, while not necessarily being exactly the same. It was impossible to defeat, say, a snapper in the very beginning of the game. Attack and defense stats were a paramount factor in a fight. If the damage is lower than defense, there would be no damage at all. It was a simple system, but with it the stats actually mattered a lot. \u2022Dialogue. There is a bit too much chatter, compared to the concise and on point dialogue of the original. Also the fading into black for every dialogue kind of breaks the flow of the game, it is just excessively showy. \u2022Voice acting. It is just flawed, the phrases have a lot of unnecessary pauses, and also don't always match the subtitles. \u2022UI. I would rather have a more simple one; also the \"4-directional\" dialogue UI is uncalled for, it probably ever really works when the choices are contrasting to each other, but that is not the case here. \u2022Other minor stuff. Like the technical issues, animations, music and whatnot. These are still a vital part of overall experience, which will hopefully be polished to a decent degree.

{"text": "Takeaway Games. Issue 9. Need for Speed \u200b\u200b- another restart of the series. When the 2012 restart of Need for Speed: Most Wanted failed miserably, and the next cop chases in Need for Speed: Rivals came out for the second time in 3 years (the first time was in Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit), then the most greedy campaign in the gaming industry decided to return to the Undergroud formula. And in order to stimulate sales, it was decided to start everything from scratch and throw out the subheading. It is a pity that the Frostbyte engine was not thrown into the trash. Why are post-apocalyptic games not very popular online? Because constantly being in despair is annoying, and players quickly throw such worlds. Why don't they make games where the game is constantly happening at night? Because constantly being in the dark is also not comfortable and annoying. The action of this part of Need for Speed \u200b\u200btakes place constantly at night. And to strain even more, the game does not work without the Internet and can throw you out of the game if you lose your connection to the Internet. \u201cEven in a single player. You can't even pause. \" (c) Gufovsky. The second huge problem with the game is physics. In this arcade racing game, you cannot sit down and drive. You need to google how best to set up the car so that it is comfortable to drive. But why? There is Need for Speed: Payback, where cars are divided into classes and you can ride them comfortably out of the box. I am glad that developers are able to admit their mistakes. The third problem of the game is the live actors in the commercials. Firstly, they are complete nonsense, from which for some reason the player is ashamed. Secondly, they constantly call on the phone and are talking nonsense already there. Even Undercover did it better. Of course, the player has a silent camera, who follows these actors and is silent like a partisan. Compared to Payback, there is a smaller fleet of vehicles, but more opportunities to pump the power of cars. But are these capabilities needed when 5-6 parameters were enough before? And after pumping the car may go worse. Amazing. Graphically, the game does not cause rejection. But the constant night makes it difficult to examine the details. Plus the soundtrack is a jumble of unpleasant sounds. There are very few good tracks. In the same Payback, half of the songs were excellent, another 25% were not bad, and the rest were tolerable. In Need for Speed \u200b\u200bI only heard one normal track. Now I don't see any reason to buy this part at all, when there is Payback, where all the ideas that the developers planned are implemented much better. I think it's time for the Need for Speed \u200b\u200bseries to either do the remasters that everyone wants (Need for Speed: Most Wanted 2005) or move on and not use the same developments several times.

Also, the graphics on the third level have like beams of light everywhere as part of the design, which make it really hard to find the next checkpoint, second level was the best for being able to see clearly, in my opinion. The game is also super inconsistent, you can jump off the same jump pad twice and get complety diffrent boosts. The same with the platforms, some times you can jump off a platform, othertimes it sends you down into the water, which,    You also have to complete a level once you start it, you can't save it and close down the game, then come back later, this wouldn't really be an issue, apart from you can't speedrun the level. Unlike with refunct, where you can pretty much take any path to reach the next checkpoint, with Ascendance there is a certain path to take for every checkpoint, you have to figure out where it is and then carfully take the time to reach the next stage.

The characters are joking; among the monsters there are many funny ones, like punk, dolls, etc. instead of consumables in dressers, we find funny objects and books, or rather their descriptions. But if for the first half hour you still find it more Cute than Funny, then then all this does not cause any emotions. The combat system is typical JRPG, but a bit simplistic. For example: was the character poisoned or died? After the battle, everyone will be healthy, except that mana is not restored entirely (in principle, there are no consumables, except for potions that can only be found). You can save at any time, anywhere, or even teleport to the city. But as for a parody, the battles are still not the fastest and there are many of them. As a result, you don't get pleasure from thoughtful and interesting combat, but you still have to fight a lot in random encounters, which is tiring. But the number of random battles is limited for each location, but there are still a lot of them. They either end at the end of the location itself, or stand and farm them for half an hour. The game also has \"Developer Comments\", which I called \"Justifiers\". You come to the question mark, and in 90% of the developer says how difficult it was to do this and that, so he took a simplified path, or did not do what he planned at all. (Really funny, huh?) The interface causes inconvenience in moments, although it would seem that the JRPG has more than 30 years of history. Of the advantages, I note the price, music and duration. True, for me the latter is more likely a minus, and for some reason it turned out 2-3 times longer than the others. There are also bonus modes for those who were not enough: passing without partners, easy passing at once with a high level, and passing for a partner Cthulhu, where everything is the same, only different dialogues and new characters.

{"text": "Is your wallet ready for microtransaction? The cons overweighs this game, only buy it when on sale and that you are a SAO fan. I would have voted it Worst game I bought this year if it weren't because I am playing for the sake that my friends play it. I enabled comments so that you can flame me, I am not a fan of SAO -abyssmal weapon proficiency system that is tied to accuracy, unlocking new skills. Be prepared to grind to 1000 whereby on normal difficulty past 500, you will only get 0.1 proficiency gain randomly without abusing partner exploit to grind their same weapon type.  -same as above, lousy weapon balancing system. Dual wield is top tier because the stats boost from both sword add up. -bug causing character to be unrecruitable. -grindy crafting and loot system. Each set of equipment has min-max stat, though you don't need max stat to clear game but people are abusing craft for free exploits to get max stat. Else you will have to religiously farm raids or keep fighting divine beast for 1 try at it. Divine beast will only spawn if you kill a fixed set of enemies, which is extremely tedious.  -weird hitboxes and brainless boss AI. It is easy not to get hit, the bosses are slow, you could just stop comboing and walk away. Downside is that this will interrupt your risk (combo meter) which in turn affect your damage.  (Increased boss attacking tendency in 1.09 but lower resistance to ailment that is not a legit way to fix overly easy AI) -Easy anti-cheat affecting performance. Uninstalling it improves performance but you won't be able to play multiplayer.  -bugged quests. Personally short of a character Reona, some gallery entries that were tied to friendship quest, missing cooking recipe that disappears from the NPC after certain time. None of the other quests were designed missable, so those are classified bugged as they weren't intended to be missable. -brainless button mashing affection system -boring fishing system, press a button, wait 8 sec for system to display what you caught. Again with the RNG on equipment stats and low % of finding weapon/ accessory from fishing, it seem a major grind to reach level 20. -grindy partner AI system that requires you to constantly use your partner so that the game register your inputs in Art Codes. If you don't use them, you could download from a pool that is available online. They were uploaded by other players. Does it really have to be that complicated when you could have given the players full customization? Else you will need to constantly issue commands to them in order to get them moving. -raid boss is too easy, the RNG of equipment stats and getting the equipment you need out of a list is probably the only reason someone plays raid dungeon. You could clear it alone but it still requires easy anti-cheat enabled. -choices in dialogue that doesn't affect outcome. The game is text heavy, I skipped all dialogues from chapter 2 to 6 as it end up a chore to read. Voice over is in Japanese and it's partial. Prepare to do alot of reading -boring fetch quests, slay x amount of enemy, craft certain stuff. None is engaging, the reward is kind of bad other than the  reward for fishing rods which affect the % of your catches -level 50 cap. Predictably the rest of the content is in season pass, level 50 is rarely the cap in RPG. It is just a rough measure what portion of the game is unreleased in original content. Look at the price of the game and season pass, would that be justifiable? -other characters don't feel unique. Exception is Renly who is the only boomerang user in the game. -grindy incantation system. You equip incantation, break it, gain ascension points to exchange with a +1 form of random lists of incantation. +1 incantation has very low rate of breaking. Imagine 20% to break when taking enemy attack vs 4% to break. That's the difference. Why can't we unlock it and buy from shop? -sacred art damage/ EVD stats which accomplishes nothing. Sacred art damage is so low that you don't even bother with offensive sacred art. Poor stat balancing system and levelling. I am murdering bosses 120-130levels higher than me. (Update 1.09 lauch extreme raids whereby 2 of 4 raids cannot be cleared due to level cap)   And bad graphics: My Eugeo pass through walls, go under floor and can even walk in sky. Proof above.

Nothing terrible, but nothing great. Voice acting ranged from  \"good\" - \"cringy\".  Story was far weaker than in many AM games - HOG/HOPAs never really have \"deep\" stories, but this one was weaker and more predictable than usual, with a very abrupt ending. Hidden Object scenes were fairly well done, with some odd or archaic names for some items (*pause game, go to Google to figure out what that word is* types...*), but still not too difficult, not too easy. Puzzles and minigames were far too easy, and had little to no challenge to them.  Felt like no effort had been put into making them require any grey cell activity on the part of the player. Honestly sad to see Artifex Mundi games declining in quality, especially those made by The House Of Fables.  The only thing this game has over a Big Fish HOG/HOPA is Achievements and (overpriced) Trading Cards. Casual games are fine, no-effort games ... not so much. If you must have all AM games... buy this one on deep discount. Honestly not worth the full price, not such a great buy for 70% off, like I paid.

The varied settings, atmosphere and general pacing of the game kept me glued til I completed the game.... but I have to say that it climaxed about 75-80% into the game for me and sort of sputtered in the end. The story got wilder and wilder and introduced some unnecessary layers and characters. The visuals are great and I love the accompanying background music (unintrusive, good looping, sets the mood just right), and some of the main characters are quite memorable, but I doubt I'll remember or care about the story even a week from now. The game interactions are heavily flavored with computer assisted interfaces and graphics. This fits in with the storyline and actually works well to frame your limited options. If it weren't for this, I would make a bigger deal from the fact that YOU CANNOT PAN THE VIEW in any scenes. There are hotspots that you can click, and they may let you zoom in\\out of points of interests or lets you move between places. NO ANIMATED zoom in\\out motion or movement between spots, except for the cutscenes. Most of the screens have animated parts, though (flickering light, billowing dusts, etc) so you'd never think that you're staring at a static picture. Oh, another negative point for this game is that the puzzles are generic ones that are skinned to fit within the game's universe. That's right, (just) visually skinned to fit in. They look right for the settings, but bears minimal logical connection to the storyline. The ones that tied in the most to the storyline that I can think of are the language translation puzzles and the password guessing ones.

You can get used to this shit. It's all about balance. Balance heroes in certain situations. This is trash. A simple example. There are situations in the game where 100% (not 99%, namely 100%) you lose to a certain hero on a certain hero. All heroes have the same hit - d1, but some have it faster, some have it longer, and some SOSET, so with certain matchups you simply lose with 100% probability. You have no chance, you just endure. Please note that EVERYONE HAS this trick, SOMEONE HAS IT BETTER, AND SOMEONE HAS FULL SHIT. This is just one example out of 100, if not more. And how can such a DERMO be called a fighting game? How can a game be called a fighting game where, in theory, it is possible to just shoot each other during the whole battle? Again, if your opponent has better zoning than you, then you lose. You can just run and shoot, whynot, it's cool and interesting to play like that, right?

{"text": "This is an updated review in light of a new announcement that Gamigo has posted on May 21st where they have decided to do a business model bait and switch from what they've originally promised. There's plenty of big glaring issues already before this happened which you will read in my review but this news tops it. The original Archeage under Trion (before Gamigo bought them) had bait and switch issues as well, unfortunately this is the same wolf just with new sheep's clothing.  Before I mention actual game issues, let's talk about the customer support for a second. Customer Support is almost non existent as tickets will literally go months without any kind of response. I've dealt with a lot of gaming companies and Gamigo's customer support is easily one of the worst out there. Archeage Unchained according to their financial report is their number 1 game for revenue, yet they can't get a support team to answer tickets? There's absolutely no reason in 2020 to have such piss poor customer service, it's disgraceful and an embarrassment.  Now onto to a few huge issues that the game has. The servers suffer from daily stability issues from disconnects to multiple crashes every day. While something like this can be a pain in any game you play it can be extremely devastating in this game due to trade runs. A crash or disconnect during a trade run can result in the loss of hundreds to over a thousand gold. Most dungeons have a limited amount of entries you can have each day, if it happens during one of those runs you lose an entry. Losing large amounts of gold and these needed dungeon runs to gear up hurt, especially in a game like this. Besides the server issues there's plenty of bugs when it comes to the UI, audio, graphics and one of the biggest item systems in the game, the Archepass. The communication between Gamigo and XL Games is dreadful and patches often go out very buggy despite known issues, sometimes even game breaking ones. Sometimes it can take months to get fixes to the major issues in the game. Another one of the big problems is that the game's population is on a steady decline, losing hundreds of players each month on both Steam and non Steam players. While you can't view the population that doesn't use Steam you can see the Steam players on   which is now under 800 peak players in the last 24 hours from this review. Even on the most populated servers you'll find it hard to find any kind of party or raid to do dungeons and other content. Even the faction war that is across every server sometimes can't even find enough players to run. I want to point out something that makes this situation with the population even worse. Most players own at least 2 or 3 accounts due to not being able to create more than 2 characters and these extra accounts are part of total population numbers. The server populations are low already which is why I don't understand why they would decide to launch a new \"fresh start\" server which will only pull people away from existing servers. One of the biggest red flags to stay away from the game is that there's a large portion of the game's population who buy gold for not just themselves but also for friends and guild members on a constant basis. What's even worse is that Gamigo is aware of the issue and does nothing about it. Being in an open world PVP MMORPG it's hard to compete or even just stay alive when you have to go against people who are purchasing gold and killing you in 1 attack even with high gear scores. Going up against players who buy gold who can just one hit you no matter how much legit work or time you put into the game just isn't fun. There's way too many red flags to recommend this game no matter what the price tag is. If you are considering getting Archeage Unchained I would strongly recommend finding another game to invest your time in. To my friends who have this game on their Steam wishlist do yourself a huge favor and take a moment and remove this game from there. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

Also easy open world hosting for random players to join your game lobby. - Make the game open and configurable so custom scripts and functions can be made for the game. - Add a free build mode with no quest (or make this optional, with the ability to create your own quest) and have everything unlocked for free. Also be able to set the propertise of your custom world and how it generates (I don't know if thats already in the game though, I thought I saw something like that).  - The last thing I can think of; this can kind of go with the ability to make your own quest, is an NPC control tool.

{"text": "As a game, the game itself- it's really incredible. When I owned this on Xbox, it was one of my favorite games at the time and was one of the best experiences I had playing a horror (well thrilling action horror) video game. However, after all this time, playing it on Steam ... I just can't recommend it. It crashes so very often. Unless you're one of the few who got lucky, my game kept crashing at random, no matter what I did. My graphics card is at it's best, I downloaded programs suggested to me by Reddit and other Steam Forums to help the game stabilize but unfortunately, the port to Steam made the game unable to stay active for too long. It will crash whenever it pleases, whether nothing is happening or a lot is happening, there's no pattern. So this is likely due to feeling outdated, but the controls feel very stiff. They tried to copy Resident Evil 4's mechanics and while it felt good years ago, it hasn't aged well. Most of the time enemies will get a drop on you simply because your movements are limited, and you're stuck facing one way until you're able to turn around but it may be too late by that point. Everything else from guns, to powers, to the enemy AI and mechanics is all great. Just the movement and limitations of the player hurts the game for me now. Having the game on full windows made it unpleasing to look at. I had to decrease it into a smaller window to appreciate the game visually, otherwise things are stretched out and look bad with the quality dropping. There aren't any options to help fix the resolution, even by manually doing so through your graphics driver / program. Amazing story, amazing atmosphere, sound is god tier, enemies and gameplay mechanics are incredible, the story is very interesting and draws you in, and the game overall is just a masterpiece in terms of being a well structured game. If you want to play this game, play it on the console, not on Steam / PC. I believe the port went poorly and the game suffered as a result, losing stability and I couldn't bear to play any longer after Chapter 2 from the constant crashing or random hiccups.

{"text": "Yonder: It was on my radar even before The Cloud Catcher Chronicles came out. Of course, I had to try this relaxing game in which you don't fight anything with free exploration. But I'm sorry ... I'd like to recommend this game to everyone, but unfortunately I'm having a hard time. Let me briefly explain why I do not recommend such a sweet, nice-looking game. First of all, nice graphics, fun gameplay and controls await us when we enter the area called Gemea. This makes us very hopeful for the progress of the game. We also have many possibilities here, such as resource gathering, crafting system, changing our clothes and appearance, which we are familiar with from many survival games. Even the crafting system is very successful. We can produce many tools in 8 different categories (Wayfarer, Chef, Carpenter, Constructor, Tinker, Brewer, Tailor, Master). However, this whole system is not very necessary for you to finish the main task. Needed for side missions. There are many regions in Gamea and each region has its own quests, happiness rate and collectibles. It is also covered with a layer of cloud (we can call it a curse) that limits our access in most places. In order to reach these places, we need to collect sweet creatures related to the main task. They are also hidden on the whole map. Some open up with few creatures, while others want more. That's why we have to wander. Apart from these, places where we can do agriculture have been added to the regions. If we want, we can feed animals, grow plant and tree species, and produce some raw materials. Do not expect a very detailed system. It is okay if you never do. But you definitely need to build the agricultural area. Why you might say it: Fast travel is done only at certain points and on the farms you open with an item you can produce. So why is it necessary? Although the game allows free roaming, it is often torture to move from one point to another. Although the map looks good, it was designed as a disgrace. Reaching a point you see is often blocked by huge mountains and deep waters. Of course, we couldn't expect him to say \"come here right now\", but almost everywhere is like this. The game forces the mountains to climb the slopes by taking ziblock steps to go on a mission that is right at your foot. This sooner or later haunts you. Fast travel points are also in very ridiculous places, so after a while you get colder from the game. I said the controls are nice. In general yes it is, but there is a huge problem with jumping. We said that your departure on duty is already disabled with mountains and slopes. Well, you might think, let me shorten the way to some climbable points. At this point you need to jump. And this is deliberately designed to be disgusting. For example, there is a small slope in front of you and you plan to jump up. If the character is adjacent to that cliff, it instantly throws you back when you want to jump forward. It does not jump right at the bottom and cannot reach from afar. Most of the time you want to jump you fall lower. It's an Alt + F4 case. Although the graphics look beautiful, the day-night cycle, and the lighting are nice, these troubles are making your enthusiasm for most of the game. The fun drops the number of floors and in the end it remains a very mediocre game. The main task can be completed in a very short time. A different fun process could be found in a game that fell on that much crafting system. But you can finish the game without learning most things. I did that. After seeing the troubles I played with the logic of let's go and go. In short, I cannot recommend. You can take a look at it if it enters the bundle or something.

I  wanted to come back to it but they started releasing paid DLC after paid DLC and although the game seemed fun, I am not someone who is able to afford to pay hundreds of $ just for DLCs in one game so I had to quit. I got back into the game around the time they released Ultimate Edition, which seemed like a great deal: you pay for it, get access to all the game content and get all the future content for free.  You can see by my hours that I played this game a lot and I had a lot of fun despite all the bugs, questionable (to say the least) balance choices, performance issues, awful cheater situation etc. And while I wasn't playing the game during that time, lets not forget about the whole microtransaction scandal they had in 2015(?) when they added paid skins after they promised that they would not. Many people quit that day. Today, months after they announced that payday 2 development ended, after the story was finally concluded, they announced that  . What does that mean for the game? There will be more content, obviously. It also means that they lied once again, that all the people who paid for ultimate edition were lied to and scammed. They even admit to it as you can read in the announcement I linked \"Now we're breaking the Ultimate Edition promise of forever-free-content\". Besides all that it also means that the story   get ruined for the sake of shoving as much paid DLC down our throat as possible, that the game balance might be affected even further, that the people who spent hundreds, thousands of hours completing the game with all achievements, trophies as such might   pay for MORE DLC to unlock certain achievements (don't forget that in payday 2 achievements that require you to use a specific DLC weapon are common). They are about to milk their fan base with DLC content, shoving as much of it as they can and as fast they can, after promising they would do no such thing. And of course there are always the people saying this kind of stuff: \"lol are you complaining about more content?\", \"just don't buy it\" and most importantly \"they need the money man\" That is no excuse to lie and scam the fanbase that stuck with the game through all the bs and keep in mind  If you are the kind of person to throw money at a company after they spat in your face good on you but they are in the financial situation they are in due to their poor choices, making games that no one asked for and the fanbase shouldn't be the one to pay for their failures.

{"text": "Bad game, but with good game characteristics. Almost two thousand hours, in three years playing this. The time has come to rate this game. \"Dead by Daylight\" has already caught my attention, firstly, in having a very striking and well-produced soundtrack, the assassins' designers are spectacular, as well as their animations, which are convincing. The game, as everyone should know, is about 4 players against 1, this being the killer, henceforth killer, who must prevent the four survivors from escaping. This idea works very well and makes us try again and again to escape, even dying all day as a survivor. Hiding behind a tree and stopping to be discovered brings a great adrenaline and satisfaction that makes the game more incredible. The best of all is the upgrade system, improving the characters and assassins to play better and in new styles. I have tried several styles myself: stealth, poker, repairman, savior etc. However, the game lacks quality as a final presentation, not matching the total value of the game, even with so much content. First, because these contents are paid and expensive. Character customization DLCs are very expensive and some, exclusively, are purchased with real money. The game never got rid of constant glitch and bug problems. These are torments that always hinder the players' experience and progress. The balancing system is never perfect. At first, the game seemed much more balanced than it is today, even though the gears that instantly repaired the generators or hooks were destroyed forever. That's because the game was more dynamic and with multiple objectives for everyone to do something for the group to benefit, while the killer had to act more strategically, be very fast. Today, however; the survivors, even together, fail to have a balanced chance to escape. That's because it's so easy to be a killer. When I play as such, I kill everyone easily without any complex strategy, as the killers' perks have been improved over time, while those of the survivors have been lowered (take the perks: explosive run or decisive strike). To make matters worse, the killer can close the hatch giving no chance for the survivor to escape. The chance for everyone to win appears only when we encounter killers who are controlled by novice players. The goal is not for survivors to flee in all matches for sure. But when I, playing as a killer, manage to kill everyone, easily, in 20 consecutive matches, it is because there is something wrong. Thus, as it happens several times, when we realize that the game is already completely lost to the survivor, it is not uncommon to find players killing or disconnecting themselves, and even in the first minute of the game. At the beginning of the launch, it was very difficult to see these behaviors taking place. The Rank system is very strange, because now your rank does not improve for you to escape or for fulfilling objectives, but doing many diversified actions in a single game, deviating from helping the team to escape with the main objective: opening the gates . Before, one of the game's proposals was for you to decide to save one person or to act in a more self-centered way to save others. Currently, if you try to save others by repairing or distracting the killer, you are punished in the rank system. If you keep repairing the generator to open the gates, the game will discount you points for not saving someone in danger. This is cool, but there are common circumstances where dropping the generator and rescuing someone causes the mass death of everyone and the destroyed generators. Egocentric decisions were important in the game to decide the survivors' victory. Basically, three years have passed since I'm playing this. The game is one of the most fun to play with friends, but otherwise, it is frustrating due to the poor functionality of the systems of rank, programming, gameplay etc. The game never felt like it had left early access. On the other hand, it is an important game for new competitors to appear with better definitions, as well as the 'White Noise 2', which stands out for its quality and execution.

Everything is characterized by mediocrity: from the plot, to the gunplay, to the level design, even the sound. I have read several reviews that have compared it to a \"cheap\" copy of Dead Space, and I am of the same opinion. It's not an exact copy, but it almost feels like Spark Unlimited (the developer) is just doing the homework swapping ideas from various famous TPSs here and there. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but the product that comes out is so flat that in a very short time it leads to boredom. The plot is very popular, with our standard model hero (male, white, family) having to do the same stuff for the first \u2153 of the game: get out of the RIG, shoot a couple of generic monsters, place the thermo column, fix the such broken stuff, etc ... From the middle onwards, the game worsens further by proposing a very long and very boring whole level, which would have the intent of creating anxiety in the player, but which on balance only ends up irritating him and compulsively pushing him to watch the orogiolo in the steam overlay, in the hope that the agony will end soon. Let's talk about the gameplay, the beating heart of the game: TREMENDO. Everything works badly, the cover system (solid in games like Gears of War) here proves to be a dancer, with the character often being exposed to enemy fire, or suddenly standing up and then crouching down. I found the fighting with the RIG quite unbearable: always the usual QTE instead of proposing a real fight. The graphics, the only element that raises the bar a little, is moved by the Unreal Engine 3, showing glimpses that are sometimes really convincing. Good snow / ice effect, as well as lighting effects. Sound to forget, the soundtrack that accompanies the game I would define inappropriate in some moments. I am aware of the amount of work that such a game requires, and I am sorry that Spark Unlimited came up with such a flat title. Basically I had the impression that they had carte blanche for the development of this third episode, the conditions for creating a nice plot and decent gameplay were there, instead they did nothing but develop yet another generic TPS standard to not to risk..

{"text": "During my schooling, I was not very attentive in grammar class. I had no problem applying the rules instinctively but rather not feeling bored with these lessons. So don't talk to me about subjunctive, verb groups, indicative and whatnot, it just doesn't speak to me. However, do I have problems with writing? I think I'm doing pretty well (right?). Am I therefore the best person to evaluate this first opus of the trilogy \u201cThe Forest of Pago\u201d? Not necessarily, indeed. But here is my feeling. For this introduction, the game focuses on, I quote, the present indicative, the agreement between the conjugated verb and its subject, easily locate a conjugated verb in a sentence as well as its infinitive and its group, find easily the subject which corresponds to it, identify the people of the conjugation, learn the endings of the verbs of the three groups and the particular cases. The game is therefore intended mainly for students in CE1, CE2 (and you should manage to finish it in less than 1h30 if you are not a primary school student, I say that, I say nothing ...). In practice, the game is a succession of tables, more or less animated, where you follow Flora and her friends in search of the truth following the destruction of the village of Pago by a huge dragon. During 21 levels, you will have to read sentences and choose the correct answer among the three choices offered. In case of error, the game offers a little reminder of the rule to follow. After three errors, the level resets, however their short duration (I counted about 15 sentences per level) does not really penalize the player. It is a shame to note that the levels do not start with a lesson and that the reminders displayed in the event of an error are not clearer. The levels end with a summary but the game falls back into this trap of offering a fairly indigestible lesson, comparable to those in French books. You have to realize that the children who could play this game are also learning to read, but the instructions lack clarity and pedagogy (no color code, use of abbreviations, etc.). I would have liked a little more inventiveness on this point, otherwise what will be the motivation of the children to read it? To conclude, I am mixed on this game but I am obviously not the expected target. Children will probably have a lot more fun with this type of support than with their school books, but will they have the courage to read the lessons scattered throughout the chapters? Nothing is less sure. I would also mention some convoluted turns of phrase due to the strict use of the present tense for this first opus. A not always very wise choice. In addition, the price of the game is very high. Of course, it is understandable that the studio is remunerated and that the development of a game takes time, but on the parents' side 24.99 \u20ac is an expensive price paid for a game that can be completed in 1h30. I would like to be able to select a \"gray thumb\" for this evaluation, this option not being available I unfortunately have to make a choice. Do not hesitate to support Futurtech if their initiative interests you and to help the development of the second opus if the crowdfunding is set up by the studio.

I wish I could give it a thumb sideays, and if it's on sale for $5, it's worth a flyer, but the TLDR is that it's ultimately very mediocre. This is as close as a game is to Gran Turismo or GT Racing 2 on Steam, a quick and dirty simcade.  I'm a bit of a completionist, so I want to acquire every trophy there is to be acquired. This has made me spend dozens of hours in this title rather than in proper sim games, and they haven't been very fulfilling.  There are hundreds and hundreds of events, and while, in the base game, they are at least grouped somewhat logically, there is no sense of purpose of achievement. I almost feel like events were created at random, and finishing them doesn't really bring any joy or sense of achievement. The AI is a special beast. I've had to learn on which tracks to put it at medium and on which to put it on hard, because in time attack mode or on ovals, I crush the field mercilessly on medium, while on the hillclimb track I barely scrape by on the same difficulty level. This game offers the same tired old super sprint race formula: you start near the back of a 16-car grid, and you have to win a 3-lap race. The problem with this formula is that you cannot simultaneously have cars of roughly your level and also expect to make your way to the front of the field in this super short period of time. So, yeah, you need to feel excited about passing cars that aren't at your level, or you have to feel content with gaining only one or two places against challenging cars. The trouble is, the game isn't designed for the latter, and it won't net you the wins you need to progress through the career. The FFB on a steering wheel feels very mushy and unresponsive, almost boat-like. This isn't ideal, and for a simcade game I'm tempted to give Codies a pass on this, but given that Codemasters have provided much better FFB in some other titles, it's not like they don't have the technology, so it's a bit frustrating. I suppose this game is mostly designed for gamepad support, but still, it's a shortcoming. Don't expect anything close to realistic physics here. From drifting formula and LMP cars to every car feeling like a 10 ton brick when bumping against it, I feel like it's more of a feature than a bug, but it does make understanding the car far harder to achieve. The car selection is outstanding, and while they feel a bit more samey than I'd hope, I suppose that's more of a physics than car selection problem. Not only that, it's an absolutely gorgeous game; chasing sunsets and seeing rays hit a damp track is some of the prettiest stuff I've ever seen in a driving game. Still, to some it up, this game looks the part, but for everything else, it's just so-so. I've had fun with it, but I wish there was a superior simcade game with actual career progression. Project Cars 2 is the closest thing, though perhaps a bit too far on the sim side of the goldilocks zone for a simcade. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

True, the hogs over time are trying to reach new levels of quality and variety of gameplay, and Jam is an example of the worst and laziest representative of the genre.

{"text": "TO KICK OFF ------------------- If you think this is your next shooter game? Better stay away. PUBG is more about surviving. And shooting it's just one of the aspect helping you to survive. Even the best gears can't save you of taking sniper shot from unknown direction, from far away, ending your match in a sudden. Looting and roaming the map takes huge part of your play time in the game.  Gameplay shooting is not bad. I like having mixture of TPS and FPS. Also the TPP(third-person perspective) and ADS(aim-down sights) combinations attracted me as well.But there are still room for improvements. Regarding developers many improvements will be delivered for final game release. I've got the game only because of the great amount of viewers on Twitch. But lately I have realized that this game is not for me. Is not what I've been looking for.  For streamers this game is great as there is a time where you can spend time to response to chat and there is a time where you should be more focused in game. IN MORE DETAILS --------------------------- If think you are about to enjoy of the game, by after having watched some the other's gameplay. Consider this:  Most of the time you are just about to loot the first place you've drop. Then run away towards middle of the circle. Where you are about to prone waiting for the final circle. At this moment you are about remain prone. The other way is to just drop where is the most popular by players dropping and trying to kill as much as possible of them. Keep in mind, luck have a lot to do with your final perfomance. And is involved in your satisfaction of the game. Like, if you think you can go for long kill streak. It doesn't work that way. Some times you can find good gears. Some times you can't find any gears that suits you best. Not just for the first drop, even till match end for you. One of the aspect I don't like of PUBG, is about having only one chance. And also you are not able to revenge. Only if you play in a group and you've got killed. Your friend/s can revenge you. Continue in this sense, the game feels better if you play regularly with friends than going solo. However if you playing all games solo, you are going to like it (in case everything above it's fine for you), because you are free of not following someone's path or stick to same gameplay every time. VISUAL ----------- Game is developed on Unreal 4 Enging. Means visually should be a masterpiece. Unfortunatelly for me the game does not look like one. Even there are some gross textures. Developers barely have put some sort of effort to make the game have stunning look. At least the characters looks fine. Speaking about characters. There are good amount of customizations. I guess they will keep this trend.  WEAPONS --------------- About weapon customizations. There are just a ready presets attachments so far in early access of the game. Not all attachments are available to all weapons. There are weapons without having option to attach scope. In my opinion in order to start feel the game you need to have at least 50 h of gameplay. Like having played with each weapon(common) at least once. Or drop at almost every popular location. GAMEPLAY ---------------- Driving key of continue playing is the feeling you can make it better next time. But me personaly, once I've tooked my chicken dinner I stop worry about this and every next match became the same as previous one.  If you still reading and thinking of getting the game. Keep in mind the gameplay skills does not have a huge path, but does requires a huge patience. You need to learn stuff like taking positions, how to move at certain time of the match. Shooting skills with most common and preffered weapons. Distance, recoil and bullet deviation are stuff you have to learn. Recognizing player's characters in distance and in foliege in your vicinity. In overall do I recommend this game. No if you looking for action. Yes if you looking for more slow pace gameplay and huge tension. Like litterary at the final circle the game is a lot tense.

{"text": "I was wrong when I first reviewed this game. It's not as much buggy as it is the learning curve is so steep it spans across all the islands threwout the entire campaign. moving back and forth, using capital gained from one park to research buildings and medicine to use in the current park. I actually have to say that it's still the hardest learning curve of any tycoon type games. Interacting with the dinosaurs is the entire premise of the game and honestly it gets boring quickly. Building pens and space management is the hardest aspect of the entire game, even on the sandbox island you don't really have enough space to have every dino and keep the park safe. the games essentially an endless dissaster. Still I only paid 10 bucks for this on sale, if you can pick it up that cheap its totally worth it if you're already a frontier fan, but honestly planet coaster beats the crap out this title still. The best part this game has for it overall is more campaign interaction then planet coaster, with at least clear and more direct goals.

PROS: 1) Classic Puzzle Quest gameplay - If you have enjoyed any of the other PQ games, the gameplay is back.  You get 3 characters on your team, who provide 1-3 abilities each.  It's still fun and addicting.  This is not my problem with the game at all. 2) Big cast - There are 33 characters and counting in this game.  Each brings something new to the table.  Sure, several of the characters are different versions of the another character (there are 3 different Wolverines), but they usually play differently enough that you won't mind. CONS: 1) Poorly timed updates - In a game like this, nerfs are a fact of life.  But nerfing a character in the middle of an event that focuses on that character is a jerk move.  Especially now that they are introducing... 2) Tournaments with entrance fees - This might not be so bad if it had been there from the start, but as a new feature, it feels like the wrong direction for the game.  To make matters worse, you can't find out the available characters for use in the  tournament until AFTER paying the costs. 3) Rising costs - There are several neat features that were introduced as crutches to help players with weaker rosters, like Shields to protect against attacks in PVP and Boosts (extra starting energy or damage) to give yourself an extra edge.  These started off being available at a decent price, but then skyrocketed without warning after everyone came to depend on them. 4) Speed-run - I don't know about you, but I like to play games at my own pace, and you can in this game... for the Prologue.  After that, each chapter is available for a limited time and disappears at the end of that time.  I completely missed Chapter 1 because of this and if you are starting now, it might be too late for you to see Chapter 2 as well.  This is made worse by the fact that some of the fights in these chapters have opponents with levels over 200 (your characters are capped at 141 until you manage to level the very rarest characters) and the fact that some levels are UNPLAYABLE unless you have a specific character in your roster!  Missing part of the story because you couldn't get a 4* Invisible Woman (the rarest character) is unacceptable. 5) Slow leveling - When I started playing, this was my biggest complaint, but I adapted to it.  I would have still recommended this if it were the only problem.  However, it is still a problem you should be aware of.  Characters require THREE forms of leveling.  First, you need covers acquire or level up your skills.  Second, there is a very rare form of currency called Hero Points that can replace the need for covers, but you will likely need it for other purposes, because it is very rare unless you pay to buy more of it with real currency.  Third, you need ISO, which is the experience of the game.  At first, you'll think you are getting a ton of it, because low level characters can get a level after a fight or two.  Once your characters start to get mid-level, you will need to win ~20 fights to level a single character by one level.  With 30+ characters that have a max level anywhere from 50 to 230, you will need a LOT of ISO and even buying it with cash won't help because it is crazy expensive. SUMMARY I love the gameplay and being able to play with Marvel superheroes.  I was willing to cope with the slow leveling until the developers started making a ton of poor decisions that favored those who are insanely high-leveled or spending cash.  I want to love this game, and if it had been released as a Single-Player game like all of the others, I probably would.  But the way it is, I just can't. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "What I'll say is just the same perspective you've seen alot around here... just in different words. Basically H1Z1 (the Battle Royale edition, I'll skip the whole game and dev splits in between) was the first battle royale around. People enjoyed it and it was overall a good time. Buggy but alpha and betas exist for a reason, right?  and PUBG is announced and released and booms the BR market. Later Epic gives a free BR mode to their survival game Fortnite (also in beta, it performs like a charm and was/is extremely enjoyable, still getting updates extremely regularly). Push out little updates every 4-6 months, such updates that were NOT worthy of the time they took to come out. Push out big updates (mostly cosmetic) and completely reworking both gun mechanics and vehicle mechanics (which only needed tweaks, not \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 reworks) into what is now the 3rd gun mechanic rework that no one \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 asked for. This shows H1 could compete in the BR market with the big boys again! Support the game! Hell yeah! So get this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665: The game is out and gets a huge publicity stunt, facebook, media articles, steam banners, etc. It's out! People will buy it more since there is alot of people who only buy the game upon release, Daybreak got a very likely boost in sales. Logic dictates one plays the game once it's bought, and according to steam's refund policy: if you exceed 2 hours of steam play time... the refund is no longer eligible. So they release this (still) unoptimized, broken and ALPHA-STATE WORTHY game and day 7 release the Free to Play announcement and make it F2P THE DAY IT'S ANNOUNCED!! And people who bought it during this week and played little over 2 hours (which is about 4 matches) can't refund it. Excellent!! One dev said in the community hub \"Hey - we can't control your luck of the day, but at least you have a few other \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to enjoy!\" People must feel so happy they paid 20\u20ac for the final product of their game to be this. Some \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665. Yay. Oh and I mentioned the 10K skulls. So get this, with those skulls, you can buy: about a mix of 3-5 clothing pieces depending on which ones you buy, a car camo or an unlocked crate + 1 skin. Wow, so much value. So much appreciation for all the support, love and suggestions we gave you throughout the game's lifespan, Daybreak. And don't forget. What would F2P users play? A game that is in absolute no way better than Fortnite for the same price... or Fortnite? We get a pistol, 2 AR's, a shotgun, a sniper, an SMG and 2 bows. Some weapons were even removed! Other BR's can get upwards of 15+ weapons!! You can reward yourself with the Edition Packs! Bronze, Silver and Gold all give skins and crates for you to open and get your mass supply of cool skins! EXCEPT THE PACKS ARE 20, 45 and 93 (NINETY \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 THREE) EUROS!!! And before you insult me for being a self entitled \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 wanting a refund...  I payed 50,99\u20ac for BRINK back in 2011 ON RELEASE. And I DEFENDED it's F2P model introduced in 2017. 6 years vs. 3 years. It honestly doesn't matter. BRINK is a full game. You get the story, multiplayer and skins all for free through the standard play everyone did back in 2011. The DLC's existed since 2012 and are cheap cosmetic aside from Agents of Change. But this... this... there is no middle finger big enough from Daybreak to consumers and from us to them as well. All aboard the big middle finger convention! I won't do the usual Pros and Cons \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, all pros this has are present in PUBG and Fortnite as well. All cons... PUBG and Fortnite have about 20% of such cons, if that many at all. A cashgrab through and through, the biggest slap in the face of the year and that I ever got. I've seen shady \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, but this level is astronomic, not even Aliens: Colonial Marines, Rome 2, BRINK were this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 up. Don't even dare download this, just don't. Play Fortnite, it costs the same and it's made with love and care and not the most \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 business practises I've seen.

{"text": "When I started playing many, many years ago (when it was still a browser-only game), the game was fresh and balanced (for the most part). Battle were fought with wit and hard work, and skillful play was heavily rewarded. After a few years, I decided to pick the game up for a few hours to see how it aged. Racist names, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 hitboxes, ear rape in-game sounds...it was not enjoyable. Germans were completely invincible and had extremely overpowered guns. (A German SMG did way more damage than my upgraded sniper rifle per shot and was way more accurate), it's nearly impossible to shoot someone out of a vehicle even if your shot *should* connect. Squadron Supplies severely limit your play time per match since they don't count on anything. I went in to a lobby and just started whaling on the enemy team. Outplaying and outaiming them at every turn. Yet, when I swung back to help my team push a point...I was slaughtered due to running out of \"Squadron Supplies\" and a random enemy I had never seen nor was anywhere close to was awarded credit for the kill.  In addition, Germans were able to mass spawn tanks and completely outgun and outnumber my team's infantry. It was absolutely terrifying and we had no way to stop it. I wish the game would go back to how it used to be. Having to wait on your teammates to catch up so you can formulate a plan and carry it out, instead of running in and spraying your gun wildly. Now, sniping is next to useless. Some shmuck with a regular gun will snipe you from 500 meters and instantly kill you, even if you're covered in camo or behind a wall. TLDR: Devs \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 the game up, Germans are literal gods, people are generally toxic with their names, a German SMG does more raw damage than a sniper rifle and a tank combined.

{"text": "I recommend this game. But for me there was a minus in the game that ruined everything that I liked about the game and this is that yubisoft decided to call the game assassins creed. Everything in the plot related to the lore of the assassins is terrible. This spoils the game and kills the desire to play it. After completing the quest line gates of atlantis, I decided that most likely I would not return to the game. Yubisoft, due to its greed, unwillingness to abandon the franchise, dealt a strong blow to a good game. Now you can go to the pros and cons of this game and the problem described above will not be taken into account. + Graphics_Playing on medium settings, I got only one pleasure from the views of Ancient Greece (but sometimes the textures go into soap) + Setting_Ancient Greece is implemented with a bang. Many great people of this time appear and everything looks authentic and atmospheric. + Role-playing system_It's not perfect, but very good. Actions really affect play and dialog choices too. The romance system is good, although there are not enough characters available. + Additional tasks_Of course, not all stages were successful in the game, but there are characters who give out interesting quests. And Socrates with his tasks and dialogues is simply gorgeous. -Farm_I spent 40 hours on the passage of the main quest. Considering that I took quests 2-3 levels higher, and to close such activities as: mercenaries, cultists, arena, at least level 47 is required. In my 67 hours I got only 49, of course, you can get this level before. But in any case, you have to spend enough time -Balance_Game is tailored for donation. If you buy a permanent boost exp, the level will always correspond to the level of the main quest. Or you have to farm, as I wrote about earlier. -Naval battles_Initially, the sea content seems interesting enough. The first boarding is very enthusiastic. But at some point it gets very boring. Why board when you can just sink the ship. Every naval battle is the same. And pumping the ship, the terrible grind of gold and resources discourages the desire to do all this. -Battle system_To fight you press blow, parry, dodge. Sometimes finishing moves occur, but they are also monotonous and occur quite rarely. But skills save the day a little. Due to them, the combat system at least somehow keeps interest in itself Based on everything that I wrote above, I can advise people to buy this game who they love the assassins creed series and its lore, or those who don't care about the world and the plot. If you are waiting for an interesting ancient Greek story, then at some point all your joy from the plot will be shattered by the desire of yubisoft to keep the franchise and shove the assassins where they don't need to.

There are questions about the order of the levels, because some of the later ones were noticeably lighter than those that were before. Sometimes it was quite painful to go through something, given the local area of \u200b\u200bdestruction from the explosion, but with the proper skill, they get away. There are only three lives in the game, which could be a big disadvantage, if not the save system, thanks to which I went through the whole game with the last one.

The balance because of this is pretty bad I found that with all these bugs that harm you, there is also a bug with gems to increase their value and get tons of gold. of course after some of my items vanishing, i figured what the heck i can use that to buy more stuff in return. Then the devs post this \"Gold/item dupe: We would like to inform you that we will fix the gold/item dupe issues later this week. Actions will also be taken against accounts who abused these issues or took advantage of it.\" THE GAME DOESNT FUNCTION and thats what you choose to focus on???? Are you kidding me?

{"text": "It's amazing that for all my love for turn-based strategies in general, I somehow lost sight of it. However, a wave of enthusiastic reviews from gamers in the style of \"Worthy competitor\" and \"This should be new\" convinced to buy this miracle. The first hour was unforgettable, I squeaked like a thirteen-year-old girl from addictive gameplay, amazing graphics, thick atmosphere and dashing video sequences, hardly inferior to those of the numbered parts. After five hours of playing, you involuntarily begin to feel that something is wrong with it, and on the fifteenth you have a persistent feeling of cheating. Naturally, it does not stand up to any comparison either with or with, and if we also take into account the chic addons to them in the form of and, then the step-by-step spin-off of the series is perceived as an inferior fool cousin. All \"global management\" comes down to shmotizm, pumping fighters (by the way, pumping is implemented quite well for itself) and opening boxes with random gear and barrel attachments. Shmotism is presented at its worst: these boots give + 7% to evasion, and this helmet + 5% to accuracy. Do the developers really think that these pathetic bonuses can keep the interest in customizing fighters alive? I do not argue, sometimes among the legendary and epic things there are interesting examples, but this does not save the day. Yes, the bonuses cannot be called bold either, but there the weapon upgrade is one of dozens of global mechanics, and in it is the only \"entertainment\" outside the turn-based games. The main scourge is that this is a dummy project. The most delicious is dumped in the first hour and a half of the game, so that God forbid you do not have time to issue a refund. Then shameless self-copying begins. You don't have to go far for an example. Along with a couple of unique story missions and as many boss battles, there are four types of missions: in a certain number of moves, save two soldiers from captivity, collect a certain number of boxes until you are covered with bombardment, hold two points and, finally, clear the map to explode stocks of miraculous goo. These side quests are mandatory. And, apparently, they are so amazing that most of the already story missions are the same. Moreover, sometimes the modifiers of such side quests are completely absurd in their plot groundlessness. Soldiers, you need to hold these points, but for some reason you cannot use grenades, or, say, a couple of militiamen need to get blood from the nose out of the locust clutches, but the initial rescue squad will not consist of two broad-cheeked snouts, but for some reason only one ... While the games in the series offer a vast arsenal of various devices, it offers a fig. Here are two types of grenades: one heals, the other cripples, go fight. For the sake of decency, it was possible to introduce at least armor-piercing cartridges into the game. But it had potential. Here, fighters have the opportunity to perform as many as three actions per turn, and this can be at least three shots in a row. With such a gameplay skeleton, a very thoughtful tactic could turn out, but alas, you will not be full of bones without meat. You will not be full even on the strength of five completely indestructible locations. Sometimes developers play with the weather and time of day, but who are you trying to fool? Even in, which was criticized for a small number of cards, these cards were much larger, and they were much more diverse. Let's return to the absurdity of what is happening, the plot of the game persistently tries to convince us that every fighter is worth its weight in gold. In fact, we are forced to go through most of the missions for the warrior-heroes, and the vegetating nouns very soon begin to lag behind in the level. What does the game offer? Complete the side mission and save new no-names with the current level! And in order for them to have enough space in the detachment, they will have to dismiss the yellow-horned characters who cannot keep up with the heroes. And we do a similar feint every hour. Elegant, however. In this situation, I was more worried about the fate of the nameless tankette from than the local resistance fighter. Having stuffed the giant creature with lead at the end of the second act, I realized with annoyance that there was nothing in it that could keep me for another ten hours of monotonous routine.

Otherwise, a nice idea. The village starts small. With just a campfire, nothing more. Each of the initially four men and women can be assigned certain activities via the upgradeable buildings.

If the monsters are unexpectedly strong, all people must first be taken out of their professions and also assigned as guards. Once the battle has been fought, each of them must be assigned individually to the respective building.

The new problems of 2020 do not go unnoticed: There is still a problem with the bullet swarm, that is, hits are not stupidly counted (most likely this is a problem in the servers of yubiks, my ping shows an average of 40-50, although the majority of Europeans have 9-10) Card revisions are poor, the balance of these cards is not equal, it remains to be hoped for further balance. New cards are not brought in. There are no new weapons. New operas are stupidly copy-pasting each other, the idea is over, or rather, the money for the yubikam is flowing like a river, which means they are so good that the players just swallow it. Indeed, over the past year, the yubiki showed a report that the game brought in twice as much profit. More and more skins, more donation, seasonal passes, how tired of all this, the game turns into a trash heap with funny skins, where all the seriousness of the rainbow has gone, this is a tactical shooter and we are presented with another colored skin.

{"text": "Freddie came out, had its pros and cons, if you understand how to play, you can kill survs. Although, in fact, this is another walking man, which suffers from 100,500 circles around the pallet + window, and it is also necessary to wait until the victim falls asleep. Survs wake up from any failure of the reaction check, that is, the self-heal strongly takes out the rink (it also increases the chance to trigger a reaction check from items and add-ons). Twenty (beginners or simply not able to play) merge with any mana, but they are already somehow used to the old ones and do not die as often as from the new. They start nagging on the forums, in the post-game lobby, and elsewhere - \"imba maniac, I'm dying, weaken it.\" At the first rank (if the survivors know how to play) it is already the turn of the whining maniac. With the current very fast start-up, the maniac has no time for anything. Even though you play well, you will still be spending a lot of time on the average Surva player while he jumps around windows and pallets. Then lift it up, get a body block, a flashlight in your face. I brought it to the hook - it's already good. Something I digress a little from the essence of the DLS itself. - Cut out the ability to quickly scatter a dream over insolent survas, who are not even afraid to shoot in the face of man, since he cannot hit right away. Now a full 3 seconds slowdown from activating sleep on the Surva. Not only will he dump him off the beaten track, but he will not be able to puzzle his colleagues with sleep removal, but he would gain time. -Increased radius of terror - which means that the aura of the Surv will be highlighted when he has moved much further. If Surv deceived or my beloved that the \"red cracks\" again gave a false trail, went in the wrong place, but until he saw that he was in a completely different place, he would return for another 100,500 time and run around. -Now the perk \"adrenaline\" removes sleep, I haven't felt it on myself yet, but it's obvious that this is another pain in the ass mana + the perk itself is buffed. -Survivors first treat the bedridden, and then only bring him out of sleep. Minus a good opportunity to play off the ground. While he would be awakened rather than raised, this is an additional time of inactivity of the recumbent, which is sometimes very critical. -Now Freddie is not constantly visible when you fall asleep, but in fragments. Like it should give \"tactical opportunities\". Against who? Against 20? They will die anyway, and the competent surv does not care much - he sees that he starts to fall asleep and gives a tear to the window or to the pallet, thereby simply breaking the distance, or even in advance got used to singing children. \"20\" Surva <man know at least something in this game Surva is above average \\ party in 4> man 1-2k hours who can play well. They always try to please the noobs and listen to their whining, since there are fewer nerds / veterans. Take DLS if you want Freddie. Effective mana on kills still doesn't change for a hundred years - Saw and Nurse. The desire to buy new DLS more and more disappears, again, only for the sake of a famous character.

You yourself understand that this is impossible. How many hours you need to spend to get the character to such a level, I don't know, but definitely not 4 days.

{"text": "I really didn\u2019t expect that it\u2019s 2020 and there will be a click to switch scenes and promote character communication! There are only 2 scenes in total, and you can only click and move between the hangar and the combat command room; it is communication, but The character who operated by himself didn't say a word, just watched others say a few words and then disappeared. For such a big spaceship, you won't even draw a pie, and even your own character can't even see a small part of the body. The production team really saves money and effort. On this occasion, the screen will tear when you turn the screen, and even the subtitles have typos... You can choose to listen or not to listen to others, because it has no effect on the plot. The so-called other people are just a few more important NPCs. You mean the others? Sorry, those are all backgrounds. The first person in the whole journey, pilot the plane to start the mission, and complete the mission suddenly and go home. Get off the plane from the hangar -> go to the combat command room to listen to the instructions of the step -> set off again, a real tool man. A highlight of the game is that you can experience the story between the two camps, so you can customize two drivers. Character skins and actions can also be obtained by purchasing or completing challenges. There are also differences in rarity between them. Although they are meaningless, you can't see them after setting them anyway (laughs). To make up for the monotony of the game content, the production team used a lot of cutscenes to match the original music. Well, fans said they watched the movie on the spot. The operation feel of the fighter is average, but the operation interface is more realistic, and there are a lot of customizable options in the cab. According to the needs of the battle, it can be adjusted between speed, firepower, and shield. The shield can also choose to focus on the front/rear. Although the performance option of balancing is conservative, it also means that neither aspect is prominent. What I have to complain about is the low intelligence of the teammate's AI. They will perfectly copy every movement of yours while flying with you. I thought that my tool man was bad enough, but I didn't expect my teammates to only stand out. My \"Zhongxing Gongyue\" is really curious about where the production team has focused their energy. Choose your faction and start matching. 5V5, that\u2019s it? There is no star destroyer, no cruiser, and there are only 4 types of small fighters to choose from. There are only 6 maps, not only common with other modes, but also very narrow. If you are looking for a fierce space battle scene, you can only say a pity. There is no star destroyer or cruiser. You can only choose from 4 small fighters on each side. The only good point may be that you can change the configuration of the fighter according to your preferences. There are no obvious advantages and disadvantages between the different components of the fighter. The increase of one piece of data will inevitably reduce the other data, which will highlight a certain item of the fighter. Performance depends on how you choose. There are blood recovery points on the battlefield, which are shared by everyone on both sides, and need to wait for cooling after use. Similarly, some components and weapons of the fighter also have a cooling time, and collisions with obstacles or other fighters will also cause damage. After the fighter is destroyed, it waits to be reset and resurrected, usually only a few minutes in a round. The game does not require the Origin lander to start, and the multiplayer mode does not require an accelerator (personal experience).

{"text": "I can't truly express how disappointed i am to see the sequel of one of the best first person stealth games of all times to be released in this state.  I made an exception with Dishonored 2 and pre-ordered it because Arkane Studios always delivered quality in the forms of excepcional gameplay, interesting plots and good optimization for PC. Now that is over. The gameplay might still be as exquisite as Dishonored 1, the artistic design as breathtaking and the plot as interesting. None of that matter when you can't play the game properly due to a few, but critical, technical problems.  Unfortunately some of them will never be fixed like the mouse sensitivity tied to your framerate, making your mouse aiming absolutely random at all times depending to where you are looking at. This one is real nightmare for me personally. Also, even if you disable mouse smoothing and friction, the mouse still feel unprecise and unresponsive due to some kind of hard-coded filter on it, that along with the FPS-mouse-tied problem i said above makes you feel more like drunk octogenarian grandpa than the most lethal assassin of the empire, destroying inmersion and any moments of joy this game could give you in the way.  The optimization on the other hand, is even worse (if that's possible). I'm running the game on a 970 OC, 2600k 4.4ghz, 16gb ram on Windows 10 Pro at 1080p. As soon as i got outdoors my framerate just wont go higher than 40FPS while looking at the open. No matter if i'm on Ultra, Very High or High, with filters or without them, the framerate varies maybe 5FPS, which is absurd to say the least. On Low i get over 50 and near 60 sometimes, but for some reason the game feels that it's playing at 30 FPS even if it's at 80. All this optimization problems are probably happening because of Denuvo's, Arkane having no clue how to optimize IdTech 5 engine, and being a console port designed for pad instead of mouse and keyboard. When you go to the controls tab in the options the first screen you get is to config your pad instead of your mouse. The mouse options are in the third tab. Priorities i guess. Mouse problems like this are very common in console ports with the sticks stuff really hard-coded in the game affecting the way the mouse should work, because it's usually emulating or dealing with stick filters instead of just being raw input.  Stay way from Corvo and Dunwall, for now. Let my broken heart and wallet teach you this lesson the easy way. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

And that's only because of the stupid mechanics with obligatory allies who need to be recruited (basically, it's to choose the correct dialogue option for random) the first time. Otherwise? Start over! It is not entirely clear in general for what audience this was done, but the game at the end of the passage looks as primitive as possible.

{"text": "The worst game ever. Don't get me wrong.  I love this game so much.  I pre-order the Gold Edition on Steam with full price.  And I've played for almost 700 hrs.  I tried and played almost every aspect of the game.  And I also constantly browsing and discussing on Division subreddit.  Frankly speaking, this is really a nice game but the devs sucks. + Really nice graphic.  Although SnowDrop is a new game engine, the graphic still looks awesome. + Cover system is good for 3rd-person shooter. + Neat and clean UI design.  Informative but minimal design. - Connection problem as always.  UBI servers are really bad that even worse in MMO. - Cheaters and hackers everywhere.  No matter you're playing in PVP or PVE, there are TONS of cheaters makes the game totally unplayable. - Looting and crafting system are jokes.  You may get nothing worthy for about 4 hours play since the loot drop is awful and the crafting requirements are unreasonable in some way. - The end-game is tedious.  Maybe it's just because this is a new game, the lacking of end-game content makes you get bored very soon. - The new gamemode, Incursion, design is quite bad.  Very small map with 15 waves of overlevel enemies only. - The PVP is totally unplayable due to cheating.  And the elite enemies distribution is unbalanced and the rewards are not scale up with the difficulty.  Everyone level up in DZ03, and nobody go to DZ06 since the rewards are almost the same as DZ01. - Currently there is no cheat detection system implemented.  They try to find cheaters manually and it's inefficiency and inaccurate. - The ban is also a joke.  Only 3-day ban for hacking before, and now it's only 14-day ban.  Cheaters still cheating. - Lots of game breaking glitches and bugs. Ubisoft ruined almost everything.  And the support is really slow and unhelpful.  I submitted a ticket to UBI support on 20th April, and got response on 6th May with unhelpful answer.  Moreover, lots of problems/suggestions on Reddit were discussed.  Redditors pinpoint the issues and even provide possible solutions.  But devs never listen.  Lots of game breaking issues are not fixed. Actually I quit this game on 20th April, 2016.  After a month later, there's still no improvement in Division.  So I totally cannot recommend this game although I want to.

And when the timer expires, the service will die. But there is one thing, they are quickly removed, and this is a hard random. Yes, it happens that the Surv has checked all the boxes and already sees the last one and goes to it, and you camp this box and the trap works, well, this is very rare. You can guard the boxes and wait for the recovery, then the result will be better. But personally, I would even advise a beginner, but for the first mana I do not advise at all, plus she has such perks for herself. Although not long ago, her observation perk was buffed and it became completely different and better.

The design of levels without any aspiration, bland and boring, With nothing more than to go through the scenarios from left to right, dodging crude traps, activating some lever and jumping on some platforms placed without any grace. The enemies are very bloody and well designed but they are beaten in a similar way without us being able to do much more to defeat them than the counter technique. And there is no more. After a reiteration of elements put to the tun-tun, the final boss arrives, which is usually somewhat more boring and tiring to overcome than the rest and to the next phase. That said, add that Andrew's graphic work is clouded by tons of high-resolution special effects flooding the screen to fill. Mix this, sprites with Hi-RES effects, which completely kills all the magic and compactness of retro-style graphics.

{"text": "Walking simulator is not my favorite genre, far from it, but from time to time something that catches my eye appears. In fact, The Town of Light's story is great, causing curiosity and agony as we explore the old asylum, making us constantly question what is real and what is insanity, who we are controlling and even who the story really talks about. Audio is also a positive part. The soundtrack leaves us tense and distressed, even though the gameplay does not show jump scare. The experience is totally psychological, according to the theme of the game. The dubbing does not change the tone and serves to immerse us in the story according to the emotions that the protagonist's voice actress wanted to pass, making us pay attention to each line of dialogue. Perhaps you are wondering \"why a walk simulator, which does the main part that the genre needs well, won a No Recommend? Below ... As soon as we take control of the character, the first problem arises: the Engine. Unity it\u2019s not a good engine or it\u2019s not well used on the PC, because generally the technical part always has problems in practically all the games that use it. In The Town of Light, the big flaw is the absurdly constant and heavy stutter, no matter if is running at 60 or 90 fps. A very annoying problem that hinders the experience, even though there are ways to mitigate it, but it will always be there, no matter the quality of the machine, a driver or Windows. The fact that the problem exists forces you to leave the game to look for solutions on the internet, things that take time and a lot of patience. If well configured it is not a heavy game and it is possible to run at high frame rates, but when looking at HWINFO data after a two-hour game without interruption, note how much it consumes from the machine, mainly (but not only) in Ultra. This is limited to 60 frames per second, otherwise it would be natural to consume as much as possible. It is a problem because The Town of Light does not have beautiful graphics, the animations are terrible and there are few dynamic objects in the scenarios, not justifying the intensive use of the PC. I am not going to pass the cloth because it is an indie product, because another walk simulator called The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is beautiful, very optimized and also independent, but uses Unreal Engine 3 in a masterful way. For this reason, it is difficult to understand why this producer chose Unity, much less when it is noticed the polishing that it did not do, including the launch of patches. Finally, despite encouraging replay with the aim of unlocking different sides of certain chapters, perhaps changing the ending, I didn't feel like playing again. Redoing everything for small discoveries and changes is not encouraging, even though it is a very small campaign. If exploration was interesting, that is, more than walking aimlessly to find reading papers or achievements to unlock, it would certainly be worth it. As it is not the case, it is not worth the trouble. NOTE: although many complain about the walking speed of the character, I found the measure. Certainly a slower movement makes the player pay more attention to the setting and history, providing a better benefit to the genre. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

I remember something that Zak Gariss ( Lead Writer of the game ) said this game is about how you want to build your relationship with rachel which I understood something : endings = intimacy points you have made through all episodes but it seems they all get cut from the game! Also fandom is going to be a toxic fandom because majority of the fans are shipping this person to that person but I didn't see anyone talking about plot and how awful the plot is! About Deluxe Edition : Bunch of outfits or better to say skins :| A short and repetitive episode Mixtape mode  --------------------------------------------------------------------- - Outfits = 3 outfits : Punk doe ( worst of all because it's not suitable for chloe she looks like a W-H-O-R-E with that outfit ) - Hawt Dawg Man ( WTF what a silly name ) is childish - Illuminati : Good one because it reminds me of chloe of season 1 and also it's suitable for her ... but most disappointing thing is characters won't have reactions to these outfits! - Mixtape mode : same cinematic scene where chloe smokes and licensed music plays with organizing your playlist :| Stupidest thing , You can either download songs or listening to them via spotify  - Bonus Episode called Farewell : short and it was just reciting things that already have been mentioned in season 1 and before the storm and it has some inconsistencies too for example joyce being a smoker and that wasn't implied in both games except in season 1 in alternative reality she was a smoker not in normal reality and of course I remember something from season 1 that max said william didn't finish painting the house and it was kinda half way work and william died but farewell plot is set the day that william died and you can see william didn't even paint the house :| like I said they mentioned same things more and more that made me bored AF :/ for instance william's death ... I expected something new in this episode like how max and chloe became friends with each other and more stories about them or i expected side activities such as playing new games or even playing video games in episode. It wasn't emotional or sth because of things I mentioned thing aboved ^ The last scene of farewell is also $hitty!  why? because both max and chloe didn't act in season 1 that this tape even exists and lack of emotional scenes... By the way , if you didn't buy this game don't buy it . buy some other indie games like inside , oxenfree and games like that not this piece of crap :/ 3/10 NOT RECOMMENDED ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Description: Puzzler World 2 - A collection of various puzzles and crosswords numbering 1200 pieces. The difficulty of the levels is different, but basically everything is very simple, difficulties can only be the last riddles, and even then hardly. The game is completely in English. As a sequel, the game, unlike the original, brought with it various innovations, in the form of additional games and an updated reward for completing levels. Pros: \u00a5 Many different puzzles. \u00a5 A system of hints that we get for completing riddles and which must be spent wisely. \u00a5 Roulette rewards after completing levels. Disadvantages: \u00a5 Unlike the first part - the choice of any level from the start has been abolished. \u00a5 Riddles are too simple. \u00a5 Achievements are too easy. If the game is designed for more than 100 hours of completion, then achievements can be taken in half an hour or an hour. \u00a5 Again, there are no Japanese crosswords (this is generally sadness-sadness-longing). \u00a5 Link a pix is \u200b\u200bthe best thing about the first part. They took it and screwed it up ... We made the map of the screen enlarged and now the decision is not that inconvenient, but extremely unpleasant. \u00a5 Do not change the screen resolution (and it is very small). Game essence: The long-awaited sequel to last year's hit on PC, Puzzler World 2 brings in more puzzles, new games, exciting rewards and a new \"Mastery Mode\". Created by the same team that worked on the original Puzzler World, a team that was able to change and improve every element of the game. With a revised selection of puzzles and mini-games, a new game mode, and a reward system, Puzzler World 2 takes the franchise to the next level! At the end of each puzzle, a bonus game opens, in which the player can receive a completely new random prize. Players can spin the wheel and watch. what prize they can get. Players can win hint tokens, which can then be used by them in difficult situations. Puzzler World 2 also allows players to unlock a special \"Master Mode\" that challenges powerful players. Key features: Over 1200 new puzzles and minigames from leading puzzle game creators - PML Play a variety of puzzles such as: Wordsearch, Fitword, Sudoku, Crossword, Hide and Seek, Link-a-Pix, Backwords, Silhouette and Pieceword Unlock additional mini-games - Picture Quiz, Splitwords, Chain Letters, Color-In, Sum-Up, Jigsaw, Hangman, Chain Letters and more! Bottom line: Compared to the first part, everything turned out much worse. Why change something that already worked great? Well, we decided to do the second part, add new games and that's it. Why touch the old? But no ... They spoiled everything and at the same time brought almost nothing new. From the graphic side, for sure. If I passed the first part 100%, then I got achievements and forgot. I do not recommend it. My rating: 4/10 ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "If you ask me, is it worth buying the game? Honestly it is difficult to recommend this game, unfortunately I am a fan of the series since I had contact with Black Flag, it was a kind of love at first sight, so I started playing the oldest and the most current ones, and there was only AC Origins and Odyssey, so I recently decided to buy the two that appeared on sale, even on sale are Expensive games (Odyssey 91 the best version) and Origins (60 full too), for some it may not be a lot of money, but if you are collecting the savings for buying them, honestly, can drop out, it does not MAINTAINY compensate if you have an average pc. Esee game was probably produced to sell Ryzen processors (which are also at 100%) and new video cards, why doesn't it make sense, I have a GTX 1080 Ti with 16gb of RAM and i7 7700K which I consider a pc until High , but even with a machine that was supposed to run with surplus I'm having a huge performance problem, probably because of this m4ld1to DENUVO and VMProtect which is a lack of respect for consumers, they put several protections to avoid circumventing a MICROTRANSATION system in GAME HISTORY MODE, this is ridiculous, if they made a game with quality and did not fail, fans of the franchise would not think about pirating, piracy is a positive point in the market, many download to see if the pc can handle it, others played pirate and took the promotion for liking it and helping the developer, but unfortunately UBISOFT is a Total SHAME! Silly stories, more and more the franchise is losing its essence and this for me that I am a fan is extremely sad, AC Origins was not even very good, this one in history is disappointing. If you haven't played AC 3 yet and want to get the most expensive version of Odyssey you win two remastered games, in moral terms, it's just one more game for you to leave in the library and never open, UBISOFT is not ashamed in the face and really remastered a game, the bugs you find in AC 3 Original you find in remastered, graphics change almost nothing and the performance is grotesque. The AC problem started with AC Unity, which was one of the biggest shame ever seen in the industry. Making an open world game with reasonable graphics anyone can do. I'm not an analyst, but it was necessary, stuttering in games is the worst sadness there is, we invested a fortune in a computer to play at 30fps to see such a shame, from 60 fps to 40 and sometimes 30, imagine for those who have a weaker machine and believe in the requirements shown on steam, downloading 100gb is sad, now if you want to be angry with this game is to leave no FPS limit, the CPU consumption is ridiculous, forcing an i7 7700K to 100 %, which does not happen by limiting. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT GAME! A tip for those who got screwed and can't ask for a refund: Lock the FPS on the MSI which helps a little more to reduce stuttering.

The problem with Piranha Bytes games is that they're hit or miss. Gothic II and Risen II were extraordinary games. Risen II is one of my favorite games (which is saying a lot, considering Monkey Island was the game that defined gaming for me). I didn't finish Gothic II because of issues with the game, but I loved every second of it, too. I didn't try Gothic I, but was quite bored with Gothic III, Risen I, Risen III and now Elex. Too bad. My problem with Risen III was that they redesigned the main female characters to give her sexy attributes. I'm no prude, but I hated that they had to objectify such a well-defined character, and turn her into a soulless pin-up. I think I never forgave them for that. Ah, well. Elex is probably good enough if you like very hard games. But once you install a trainer to at least progress a bit through the game, you realize it's quite similar in spirit to Fallout 4, but without its cast of characters, and with much less to do.

{"text": "At first I wondered why this game had so many negative ratings. So I bought it at a discount for 10 euros to find out. I defeated the first two bosses. It was fun. Until I started fighting the third boss - the Confessor. That's when I found out that the important thing in this game is speed and dodge. My warrior moved as if he was swimming in tar. So I just decided to run around and hide in these chapels. But the figure gets tired as quickly as the asthmatic, and I couldn't even get away from his anchor. I struggled for 2 hours with this one boss. And this one boss changed my opinion. Throughout the game I felt that I was a bit slow, but it didn't really hurt the previous bosses. I slaughtered the first the first time and the second the third. It was fun, I even wanted to give a positive review, but unfortunately I can't, because: the character is too slow (a warrior anyway), the camera work is difficult, I often couldn't hit the opponent, the hero's hitbox is definitely too large, and the range of his weapons is too large little. Bosses aren't that strong after all. It's just that the game is made in such a way that it is hard to play. I happened to get stuck between invisible walls, or just get stuck in an opponent. Besides, the story isn't very interesting either. Lords of the Fallen is simply a copy of Dark Souls. And it's worse.

{"text": "I have been playing the game for about 3 years without depositing money, and now I continue to play just because I cannot quit just to avoid my efforts. The game is completely based on the P2W system, as everyone has stated, so this means that the money is based on the logic of the whistle (whatever the rest of them eat). I am calling out to friends who want to play this game, if you are not going to invest serious amounts of money and if you are going to continue the game like I did, try to come somewhere with your own efforts, but do not start this game, do not even pass by. This appeals to people who have game money and are always willing to invest money in the game, so I wanted to address this issue without any review on the content of the game. Putting the deposit aside, you have to take into account that you have to spend a lot of time on the game. The game is really nice in general, but the injustice in the game has reached incredible levels. If we try to write about the injustices in the game, it would be a book, but to give a small example, the amount you need to open new 5th tier troops is 20,144 ancient books = millions of gems = billions of money, which is not possible for F2P people, even for those who invest money. In short, the powerful develop in a short time by constantly investing money and add strength to their power, while those who do not deposit money are counted where they are and even negative. Based on my own experience, it is not possible for you to accomplish great things with your own efforts and play with pleasure in this game, because you have advanced players in astronomical dimensions and their number is extremely high.This is the biggest reason why I give the game negatively. Even if I was an ultra-rich person, I wouldn't invest in this nonsense.

I'd suggest the devs go back to the previous stage of the game and improve it. + The Challenge levels are pre-defined and were fun to play; it took me a short while to complete them all, but they weren't that bad; - Generated repetitive levels, gets boring in a short while; -Lacks initiative, there are only 2 types of enemies, 2 types of traps and 1 weapon; -Boss levels are random aswell, many people complained that they had to play dozens of stages to finally reach a boss area; -More soundtracks were welcome.. I would recommend   only if you really can't afford any other platformer out there. Even then, you would probably put it away soon.

{"text": "F1 2019 embodies what people say about Formula 1 who have no idea: \"Boring\". A lot is great, a lot sucks. You enter through a massively difficult race, you get a little panic at the beginning and reduce the difficulty to easy. Because you cannot change the difficulty during a running season, the game is no longer challenging after 3 races and a short familiarization with the physics. Some sort of \"automatic difficulty\" would be optimal. You deliberately screw up qualifying so you can overtake a few more cars. It's the little things that frustrate you without end. It starts with the race control blaming the player for every collision, even if the AI \u200b\u200bdrives you in the back. If you crack and the car breaks down, you go into the automatic flashback and continue the race, so you make a 15-second journey into the past and go on. The contract changes are completely ridiculous and far from reality, after half of the season Grosjean suddenly drives at Racing Point, Hamilton has switched to Ferrari and Russel drives for Mercedes. Apart from a yellow flag for 10 seconds because some engine breaks down, nothing happens. No safety car, no accidents, no termination of the race, no restart or the like. In between you get a brief notification by radio: \"Brief information about XXX, it seems to be a serious problem, you are giving up\". And then there were only 19 drivers. It's like any other Automobile Sim, only with better graphics. You only get to hear the same trash over the radio all the time. You also have no freedom of choice as to which supplier you buy which parts from. As an Alfa fanatic, for example, I can't decide whether I want a Ferarri, Honda or Mercedes engine. I can only buy new ones when the old ones are down. I'm in my second season now and the game is just sucked out. The multiplayer can be trashed like in any racing simulation. The most exciting experience so far was when my transmission broke during training because I ignored the service life. The gearbox is then no longer reorganized and I have to go into the pits. What was going on on the slopes when I couldn't complete my training goals ... Young, young It's such a shame.

Mainly the game does not work, unbalanced due to the players and their way of playing as it is mainly based on luck and the skills you have. The reason? The players lash out at you en masse so as to have the kill confirmed and then move on to a next target, it is not a real pvp, but a mass rape ... The worst is being in front of players who lagging or spamming the main attack, difficult to manage but easy to ruin the game, not to mention that the ping (rarely) increases totally randomly, although the connection continues to work in the same way, without mentioning the game search menu, putting the timer on you would probably be able to spend 5 minutes good and good. Despite these problems and an endless wait I decided to try most of the modes in sigleplayer with bots, and guess what? I was hoping it was interesting and it could entertain but I was wrong, auto aim bots are quite difficult to take down, think when you get a dozen (this happens even when you set a few bots in the game), you die and then respawn and start over again the delirium. I was expecting a game similar to Stronghold, a new and different type of Stronghold as the buildings, troops, weapons and constructions are the same, or at least they really resemble each other but the gameplay strongly deviates from what is expected. really play. In the end, if I should do a summary of Mordhau I would simply say ... * Medieval Battlefield 1 *.

Play on your smartphone, the game is at least updated there, but you will have to pay more for the full version as opposed to steam. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "What can I say about \"Good Morning\", it's an Open world Sand Box game. You can basicly go wherever you want and do what you want. Become a bank robber, a drugdealer, a serial killer or be just the guy next door. Let me just start with saying that this game in is Early Access and looking at the game how it is at the moment I surely hope it will stay in Early Access for now, The idea is good, the result so far is not so good. There are a bunch of serious performance issues, I played the game for about half an hour a died twice because I couldn't walk anymore because of the lag, I took on the role as a mass murderer and started killing everything that came in side. Eventually I was very wanted and the police came for me but when I started stacking body's the game just couldn't handle it, it became extremely laggy and eventually the game just freezes. The world is designed in a very minimalistic way, because of this the map looks really empty and boring and not very inviting to start exploring. Same with the buildings you can enter everything but they are basicly just empty shells with nothing in them. I really like the idea and really hope the dev(s) can and will fix the issues, It has the potential as a very fun game but as of now I will give it a thumbs down. I will come back to this in a few months to see if there is any improvement but I have a feeling that this game has been abandoned. If they do fix the problems and turn it into a better playable game I will reconsider to give it a thumbs up. Pros: - Large open world - Almost every building can be entered - Simple controls - Fun concept, could turn into a really fun game Cons: - Long loading times sometimes - Horrible performance issues, both on the lowest and highest settings, extreme lag when you kill a few people in the same     place. - Terrible Graphics, Polygone style gone wrong, little effort has gone into placing buildings and trees in a natural way. - NPC's all look like stickmans and only have the most basic of functions, some run away when they see you with a gun,     the guy mawing the lawn couldn't care less and almost asks to be killed. They have no faces, they have no gender, and     only some of them say very basic stuff (vendors) - If the NPC's say something you can expect a few spelling errors. - The gore used in this game is not inline with the polygone style, it looks weird and doesn't fit the game. - No options, no way to get out of the game in a normal way - No achievements, No Tradingcards This game is for an adult audience the game includes: Guns Gore Drugs Violence small amount of racism small amount of sexual content ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": true}

Currently Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies sucks, it's not worth just wasting time playing. Why this game has a bug, and what annoys me the most is that they are old bugs and the developers don't fucking do anything. The sole function of the developers is to put new stupid weapons to be sold in the store. (Concern about the game 0%) The creativity to create weapons is surreal, in the game you find a guitar weapon, violin, doll, churique, fan, slingshot, etc ... Apart from the huge amount of items you can use in your body like Penguin, pumpkin, wings, nuts, heart and various baitolage. Often out of nowhere the game starts to close on its own, giving connection problems, bugs when entering a certain server or room. Even if you report errors and bugs to the developers, they give you an idiotic answer and the game remains the same, it even looks like telemarketing. (What irritated me most about the game) Now the game has a server for South Americans, even so unbelievable things happen. You are running away from a zombie and out of nowhere it catches you 3 meters away, this is very annoying even if you are playing with 10 ping on the South American server. Some zombie scenery maps need to be reset to 400 times to unlock an achievement, because this is ridiculous before it was 100 times and it was still a lot. The game has achievements that cannot be achieved, apart from the rules for the achievement to be validated. The game has some good points, but it is very annoying to have to deal with numerous bugs that are not fixed.

{"text": "As a fan (of the series, not the boobs), I am rather very upset by what we have now in the new part A, we have the following: - Awful in some places graphics, worse than in the fifth. It looks juicy in colors, but a lot of \"bad\" ones are very striking - Just completely krinzh cutscenes, made in advance in 720p - The plot is purely for show - Character customization, which is not customization at all - Half of the content was simply transferred from the fifth part (costumes, arenas etc). - The content itself is terribly small for a 2k game, it feels like early access is a lobby that could not be started again at release and was postponed until March - Grind. If in the fifth part you opened one costume per arcade for the character you were playing for, then here you will also receive a \"scheme\" of a costume for a completely random character - The price of the season for many is higher than the game itself, although this is no longer new, there are still many tons of DLC fans are waiting ahead, who are unlikely to go far from the price of the seasonpass. The feeling that you are playing the fifth part did not leave throughout the game. Perhaps for many this is a plus, but, excuse me, I'm not a repulsed fan of the series, but just a fan, and when they release such a stump, almost no different from its predecessor, with a price tag of 2k - just meh. I did not expect something grandiose, did not expect completely new mechanics or gameplay features, but I also did not expect such hack, I was very disappointed. I strongly advise against buying a game for such a price - it is not worth it. I have nothing against the series, I am again a fan, but it is the sixth part that looks as if they were doing it in a hurry. Repulsed fans, for whom the main thing is boobs and boobs, will probably even go. It is a pity that I am not like that, perhaps I would not have made a return and would have played without noticing all the shortcomings. If you like the fifth part and you do not mind playing it again, only in a slightly different wrapper, take it strictly at a discount, but for now, save your money.

{"text": "I don't know how such a game could be made. I really don't know. Did you think Fallout 3 was the pinnacle of the bottom? No, you are wrong. What is Fallout 4? I'll start with the most annoying things. From the very release, the game did not have adequate difficulty settings, and the \"survival\" that was originally sewn in is generally complete hell. You had to plant 20 bullets in the head of an enemy with a lead pipe, which kills you in two hits. Maybe I'm exaggerating, but after seeing the mission to save Valentine, I generally wanted to throw the PC out of the window and go crying, covered with a blanket, there was such a balance and interest from the gameplay. I'm a pretty good player, but since I was more involved in roleplaying and always lugging something to my bases in the wasteland, from time to time improving them, I really did not improve any of the weapons, and due to reluctance to spend caps I almost did not use consumables like grenades. I think that if you do not initially pump all the points into the combat perks and set your brains on fire with thoughts of how to upgrade which weapon and how many grenades to stock up, then such missions in the middle stage of the game will never be completed. Okay, all this was before, but now, for sure, everything has become better and the nonsense is fixed, a person who has not played the game might think. No matter how it is. An update for the survival mode is coming out, which our Todd Howard is still very enthusiastic about, but what do we get with this update? The first few lines of description are even pleasing to the eye: the character's thirst, hunger, the need for sleep, changes in the carried weight, a new feature \"adrenaline\", a realistic combat system (1-2 shots to the head and you are already a corpse, the same with the enemies) ... But what goes on next ... Just think about the essence of what has been written: all the saves have been REMOVED, now you can only save by sleeping in bed, cut out a fast travel (you should have seen the size of this world, damn it, if you collect all kinds of rubbish and stagger back and forth , and not run through the story company). And hunger and thirst behave absolutely inadequately. Perhaps someone will like the lack of saves, it still adds hardcore to the game, but in a post-apocalypse game, I would like to have an atmosphere due to the complexity and the ability to die for any little thing. Yes, they will clearly allow you to customize this mode to your liking, they will not force all players to play with such a specific gameplay if the player selectively wants to get something from the mode. ... Do you really believe that? Yes, they thought of leaving such an unbalanced mode without any possibility of adjusting it. Plus, they \"banned\" the console in it, and the \"tfc\" command, which helps to set up the camera as needed and take a screenshot, as far as I know, was completely removed from the game with the release of the update. In addition to all this, I, like other players, want to note that the paucity of dialogue is very upsetting. Quests do not shine with an interesting plot either. The main plot twist can be predicted by many almost at the very beginning. Character customization is not done very well, although it is not really needed here, so let's not quibble. The armor of the BS and the Enclave, as for me, was drained here, what kind of batteries from the flashlight are there, that they are discharged in minutes for three runs in it? There are some disadvantages that will be individual for different people. But despite all this, I can say that the game easily finds its audience and has many interesting ideas and gameplay features. To play it ... but you can't play it in any way, they didn't bring in adequate settings for a person. I generally cannot tolerate this broken feature with survival, and without elements from this very survival, the game does not feel the way it should, and I also want to choose the balance for the battle myself, so it's not comme il faut. Since I cannot play the product at all at the moment, and I think other people may have the same reaction to such ideas of the Gazebo, I cannot recommend it. I will follow the updates, and if one day the patch \"fixes\" the game, then I will go through it, and it is quite possible that even more than once. By the way, I'm not the only one who dislikes this survival and wants something like in Vegas, on the Internet I came across more than one topic describing the same problem. To take or not to take the game now is up to you. If you still read my angry review to the end, then the review is welcomed, positive or negative. Thanks for attention. P.S. There are a couple of inaccuracies in the review, which were then corrected in the comments. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "In short, I dislike the game because of its frustrating and confusing experience from some undesirable mechanisms. I play games to have a smooth and enjoyable experience, not to relive similar frustrations or challenges encountered in real life. The game doesn't satisfy my need.  The 6th reason I listed below has spoiler by the way. The story is nice, but there are a few flaws make the game much more less enjoyable as follows: 1. The option selection is extremely clumsy, this is particularly troublesome when I faced multiple choices, in the later investigation stage for example. I mean the cursor seems to be frozen in a very small area, so you can't freely move it around when there are multiple options. I mistakenly selected the wrong option countless times due to the clumsiness of this \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 system, other than my judgement.  2. The game lacks proper prompts as the instruction for next action. One thing makes me particularly annoying is when there's no guidance/objective to prompt my action. And there are so many times I didn't know what to do in this game, even hours after playing it.  3. Too many \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 puzzles. I play games to relax, not to think hard like when I work or study! This sort of game is more focused on the plot, not solving puzzles.  4. The rewind mechanism quickly loses its charm once you familiarize with it. Basically, it's just trial-and-error/SL trick.  5. It the only game I know that can't show up main menu after pressing \"ESC\". One replacing way is to press \"Alt + Tab\" by the way.  Another confusing experience.  6. When Chloe found Rachel's dead body, why was the music so \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 happy? This is so not immersive! It completely ruined the vibe there! These issues have one thing in common: they greatly disrupt/slow the game pace/progress. So what I feel is I spent so much time dealing with something relatively unimportant, which resulted in much slower progress in the game. Intuitively, I felt the game is very tiresome to play, because I spent much time on it, while the progress was very slow. I wish it could have the mechanism like Telltales, except there are valid consequences for each selection. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

In addition to the final chapter, devoted entirely to Miray, the script mainly told about the protagonist and his friends, it was they who worried me more than the future girl of the hero. In general, the motivation of the hero to run after her and do stupid acts is not clear. Notes: * No change in relationship with her sister Rin is shown. * Lillian and Lucas. One of the most interesting things in the novel that interested me, a rather long intriguing moment, is the romantic conflict between the protagonist, his friend Lucas and mutual friend Lillian. Which ended in nothing. There was no plot denouement of this intrigue, no consequences. And the dramatic notes are quickly washed away by the snotty final chapter and the final stupid happy end. * Drawing in some places sags a lot. * Soundtrack is weak. In general, in this novel, the choice of the hero does not affect anything absolutely. Some choices only lead to more interesting dialogues, and in some places even to scenario inconsistencies. For example, a scene with a window, when choosing the first option, when the hero runs away from home, the sister does not react to this in any way and somehow gets to know Miray. This is a scripting error. The presence of elections is pointless, the plot is completely linear. The author of the game just wanted to show a romantic story, it turned out not original and in places stupid. There is a lot of excess water in the plot of the novel, and it does not end with anything like that. I didn't see what I wanted to see in the game.

{"text": "Despite spending over 600 hrs in this game, and currently being in Infamy 10th, PAYDAY 2 had its good times and bad times. Basically a love/hate relationship with this game.  Pros - - You get to play in many different heists, special contracts, and levels - Community still offers minor updates every once in a while - Extreme amounts of availability for customizations on your character and weapons - Leveling up, especially being promoted to further Infamy levels feels rewarding, along with the after-match rewards you gain by securing loot (money/coke/etc.) - A few memes can happen occasionally anywhere. Who doesn't love them?? - Certain players can end up liking this game so much, to the point they grind a lot or consider this one of their favorite games to be somewhat-addicted to. Cons -  - Getting disconnected while in-game during a few occasions, which can be insanely frustrating. - You're going to get judged or treated harshly by players who are more experienced than you (with the purpose of them wanting to assure success to matches without any issues or fails from other players) - Expect to get kicked or even banned by a lobby's host for reasons, like taking too long to load, making issues, so on, so forth (related to previous con) - When playing a level in STEALTH, there will always be people that mess up, which annoys other players. (Though this can be adjusted in this host's lobby settings, including the addition of desired restrictions) - PAYDAY 2 can end up lacking constant taste for some players, as the game seems repetitive with the same usual playable level and contents, and that the game doesn't look like it ever changes much, especially from some updates. It's pretty much going to make players feel like this is the same game over and over, as soon as they launch it. - The game's repetitiveness and minimum appeal to players will make PAYDAY 2 seem like a boring, dry, and worthless game in certain times, and not worth wasting time on. - Adding on to the previous con, you're basically going to end up playing the same heists and stuff over and over again everyday you hop on PAYDAY 2, for 80% of your playtime, without anything changing or seen as interesting. Overall, I know I may have bashed the game a bit too much, but it's my own personal thoughts about it. Like I said, PAYDAY 2 can be a love/hate product to players, depending on how everyone's taste over content is. If you enjoy the usual feel of the game, go for it. If you can't seem to be interested CONSTANTLY, because of how the game slowly dies and feels dry on you, then don't waste time hopping on. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "This review contains only the opinion of the author regarding this game product, which may not coincide with yours. I'll start with a little prelude. Each of us, when getting acquainted with this or that game, expects to get pleasure from it in one way or another, which both justifies the price that the creators of their creation ask for, and the time given to it. Game developers use a variety of ways to achieve the goals of the player. The main ones are either through \"gameplay\" - the creation of special game mechanics, in which the player, in case of success, experiences a feeling of happiness from the result of his actions, or through the plot - the player's immersion in this or that story, which is covered by the general message of the creator, the so-called idea. Eliza is not difficult to guess trying to \"satisfy\" us through the plot, but did she really manage to do it? Now let's figure it out. Before delving into the details of the plot, I suggest that you familiarize yourself with some of the gameplay elements. The game provides for certain moments where the player must independently choose one or another solution. So there are 2 types of choice. The first of these influences further history; this or that ending will depend on it. The second one affects the so-called \"karma\" of the character and the response of this or that character after this choice. What is Karma? Karma is simply an icon of a character in the codex - a short description of the character's history. These karma points do not affect the subsequent behavior of the hero, and even more so the ending, these are simple pretty images of the main characters, but nothing more significant. This karma scale has not brought any innovations to the genre of visual novels. Visual design of the novel. It is worth to pay tribute to some of the arts in the game are really very soundly visualized, although the depicted on them in some cases does not quite correspond to what is described in the story, but this does not detract from their beauty. Some of them can be classified as extremely wobbly. In general, the visual component can be approved. The artists were certainly not too lazy. Plot. In it, the creators have done the most blunders. One way or another, the whole action revolves around Lizanka, the hostess of the tavern. In fact, the game tells 2 stories. Exit to one or the other depends on the choice at the beginning of the game. And the main problem lies in the fact that the characters are not sustained. In the first thread, she appears to us as a freedom-loving girl with the makings of a manipulator in relation to each character, whose image I was extremely impressed with. Everything is subject to her own interests. She knows what she wants to achieve from people and through certain tricks, especially in relation to men, she always achieves the result she needs, even if they try to resist her will. In the second branch, she appears as an ordinary melancholic simpleton who forgot about her freedom and, without hesitation, exchanged it for love, which is not typical for Eliza from another branch, who for some time thought that it was more profitable for her. Unfortunately, the positive impression of what is happening in the game is violated by the moments when the igruha herself neglects and forgets both the laws of common sense (the moment with the knight who reads the book, apparently hoping to find peace in the tavern dining room - this is probably a quieter place than his own number), and about those laws of the game world, which she herself puts before the player (Eliza reveals the lies of two actresses who are supposedly noblewomen, guided by the fact that noble girls travel only with their accompanying guards. In another branch to the tavern a real wealthy noblewoman Francesca, who for some reason also traveled unaccompanied, is already coming to Eliza). The main disadvantage is the lack of any artistic value of this product. In fact, this is easy reading, which is even lower than all the Akunins, Dontsovs and the like, who at least have a more literate and pleasing to the eye syllable. In total, I recommend igruhu for those who do not like to think and especially deeply delve into the plot. For everyone else, I don't recommend it. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "---- tl;dr Graphics/Art: 6 Sound/Voices: 4 Gameplay/Controls: 4 Story: 3 OVERALL: 4 ---- Shame really, the title Redshirts is playing on the Star Trek trope, that the security officers in the eponymous coloured top die on almost every mission. Instead, we are treated to a very clinical view of the future, where your only real ability is to communicate exclusively via Spacebook (yes, Facebook, in space), and meeting up with people at your job. To speak with anybody, you literally have to message them on Spacebook (which doesn't get responses either), 'like' their statuses, or invite them to events. The interface is convoluted and hard to understand at first, but you get the hang of it. I do feel they made it overly complex though. The story is non-existent, you are on a space station in a disputed region of space. Near the beginning of the game, there are rumours about something happening to the station in the future, and you then have a countdown to how many days are left. It is safe to assume that if you are still on the station, you're not going to live much longer. Each interaction with people gets you either positive or negative friend points with them, the more positive you get, the more likely they'll accept your friend request. You can also request a relationship, and there are no boundaries here, male/male, female/female, gender neutral etc, though the characters there do have preferences. Each action you do, from liking a post, going to eat, buying something from the shop, takes up 'action points', and you have so few per day it gets annoying very quickly. Generally you get one before work, then 3 after work. On weekends, you get 6 points to spend. Big events need more time as expected. You can also level up your skills to get a better job, or change your primary interests, which will get you the friends you need. In order to progress up the career ladder, you need to have a certain level in specific skills, or you can be great friends with the boss. In the end, I managed to request relationships with the bosses, so they overlooked my missing skills, and even if you break it off with them, you don't lose your work! You do go on away missions, and though I have yet to die (even when I had very poor health) almost certainly people you know will die, which makes you sadder. You learn of the few ways to get off the station, and soon you strive towards that. I think I may have finished it a little early, since I was on the final career level and have already bought a shuttle ticket, though I wanted to buy a second for a friend, but there was over 90 days left. The art is basic, and nothing worth mentioning. The sound effects and music are average, but dull, perhaps Steam Music may help to alleviate it? No voice acting as well. Worst of all is the gameplay, there is none. Get friends, go to events, work, have a romance, all to get yourself away. It's all very cold and calculated, since you don't really feel closer to even your significant other in the end. Spacebook statuses are mostly duplicated dozens of times during the course of the game, ruining the immersion. While I understand having unique sentences for each of your friends to have through the numerous day is hard, it still annoys me reading the same thing. Overall, not worth a buy, unless you're like me and bought it in the Bemine 11 bundle. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

After that, however, the novelty of   aesthetic can no longer paper over the sub-par game design. It's a first-person shooter in which the \"fire\" button doesn't always work, enemy design lacks variety (almost all of them use melee attacks or fire the same green pellets at you), battles take place in open spaces with little opportunity to use the environment to your advantage, and the lack of checkpoints means you'll lose fifteen minutes' worth of progress if you make a bad jump and fall into the insta-death abyss. One level in particular -- with inadequate supplies of ammo, copious opportunities to fall to one's death, and uninteresting battle design emphasizing long-distance shooting -- took me a week to motivate myself to complete, because the slog just didn't seem worth the investment of mental energy.

{"text": "Almost 5 months development time for the new DLC from Planet Zoo. That certainly means that the developers have taken the many negative reviews of the last \"enhancements\" to heart and are now improving the content? The reality looks different, more development time for consistently low content. 5 animals which were partly recycled from known animations and changes in textures, such as the cassowary / ostrich and the dingo / wilddog. I think the koala and the kangaroo are beautiful, but not enough. The terrarium animal is very nice. Why not invest a little more time for the emu, which also differs little from the cassowary? The components as always, some of them quite nice, but not even remotely worth the money. After the unsuccessful attempts to create an extensive Arctic and South America pack, the potential of an Australia pack has now been skillfully given away in the usual tradition! A future European pack with 5 animals (lynx, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, wild boar, and fallow deer + the terrarium with a frog, for example) would almost be a stroke of genius ... Here too, countless animals would miss their entry into the game, because the European animal world is very diverse. Brown bear, martens, badger, red deer, roe deer, squirrel, beaver, elk, raccoon, goat, sheep, hare, mouflon, pot-bellied pig, ibex, donkey, chamois, marmot, pond turtle, gray wolf (already included in the main game) and much more. A similarly diverse array of animals could be put into a terrarium. Toad, horned viper, adder, slow worm, forest lizard, garden snail, salamander, hedgehog, field mouse, aspic viper and much more. I will not go into the water and bird species at all, as this has still not found its way into PZ. How many bites have to be waited and bought for the total scope of a zoo tycoon at that time ??? I think most of them have forgotten that an expansion package at Zoo-Tycoon2 consisted of between 20 and 25 new animals, new game mechanics such as stage shows, water shows, etc. Now there are gamers again who defend this by saying that the graphics were also much weaker. You have to know that there are completely different technologies and techniques in development today! Expected more from Maxis - sorry Frontier. In this example I have to say that Maxis usually offers more to customers. On sale for 4.00 - 4.50 euros OK. I have to keep saying that I am willing to pay more, but I would also like to see that the developer makes an effort. I find it frightening that there are astonishingly many people who think the approach is great and celebrate it, the expectations of today's players are obviously sinking into the abyss ??? Saying the developers listen to their community is only correct to a very limited extent. PS: The path system is still really bad. Raised paths always form curbs and ugly crossings. With the setting Flatten terrain, the terrain around the path is also changed, why not only directly under the paths? The paths cannot be connected completely freely either, but block each other. Unfortunately, this is one of the biggest problems, and it is almost 100% certain that it will never be fixed, as Frontier is obviously unable to do so. Hope there will soon be competition from other developers in the field of zoo simulation. Update 08/28/2020 I read a review that says that the price is justified because all the many employees have to be paid. I'm ready to pay more as soon as I get the impression that the many employees are actually working intensively. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

However, the game turned out to be very raw, but let's talk about everything in order. We play as a spaceship, which must dodge other ships flying into it from the opposite side. We have three lives for which we must destroy the maximum number of enemy spaceships (various improvements can help us with this). Lives are lost when faced with an enemy. Control is carried out only with the mouse: by moving the mouse we move the ship, LMB shoots with the left guns of the ship, and RMB, respectively, with the right ones. There are only two buttons in the main menu: \"play\" and \"exit\", that is, we do not have the opportunity to change any settings, for example, adjust the sense or make the music quieter. After a loss, a new game starts immediately, which is a little annoying. In order to understand how the game works, it won't take much time, two or three minutes will be enough for you (although, for example, I did not immediately manage to find the upgrade menu that opens when you press the Esc button), therefore, you should not expect variety.

But the PC port for this   is just a pathetic excuse. And this is a real shame because this isn't just one of your typical remasters. I can easily classify this as a full-on remake. The graphics, textures, lighting are so good and pleasing, the weapon sounds are extremely high quality and pleasing to the ears, the immersion is top-notch and the small little details add on top of this makes this game worthy of the title of a Remake. But the PC port is perhaps one of the worst I have ever experienced forcing me to give it a negative review. It is 2011. A civil war has broken out in Russia between the current government and an Ultranationalist faction who are wishing to restore modern-day Russia to the Soviet-era glamor. Meanwhile, in the Middle East, a separatist group led by Khaled Al-Asad overthrow the government of an unnamed Middle Eastern country through a Coup d'\u00e9tat promoting the US to lead an intervention to avoid the destabilization of the region even further. In the meantime, a new recruit by the name of John   MacTavish is undergoing his final recruitment training in the S.A.S   before joining Bravo Team on a mission to the Bering Strait.

Unless you're planning on purchasing IW then I highly advise you to steer clear from this donkey sh*t of a PC port. If you're looking to replay the COD4 campaign out of memory or nostalgia then do yourself a favor and just buy the original COD4 on Steam or go and buy MWR on the console. Only buy MWR if you're an achievement hunter and wish to collect all of the achievements. The original COD4 doesn't have achievements which is what prompted me to buy the remake in the first place. Whatever your decision for purchasing MWR will be in the end, do know this.

{"text": "Picture this: a hard-boiled man in a suit that walks like he's covered in tar, and despite pinpoint accuracy he will only shoot the target closest to him on either side and after this mission he just walks around town doing nothing for long stretches. This might be ok for a few scenes in a movie, but actually playing it is peak frustration.    Arrest of a Stone Buddha manages to be both a mouthful and a handful. There are two distinct portions of gameplay: the shootouts and the downtime. Each of these parts have their own quirks and frustrations, and maybe there is satisfaction to be had. The difficult part is that this game is that you feel the auteur breathing down your neck at every turn. The shootouts feel obtuse at first, but can slowly become comfortable. As mentioned, the protagonist cannot be bothered to outrun a sloth dying of old age, but he sure can shoot; the shooting is done either left or right, but it will only hit the enemy closest. Enemies die in one hit while the player can take around 4 shots before he slumps over. This is a problem because enemies come in (possibly) endless hordes for most levels. Enemies come equipped with pistols, rifles, or shotguns. Enemies draw their weapons at random times, so if 5 suits charge at the player but only the last one has his weapon drawn to fire, the player will need to shoot the enemies in front to get to him. Ammo is limited, so the player can also disarm and maim enemies to grab their weapons to be able to keep shooting. Weapons can't be picked up from the ground. This juggle between trying to grab enough weapons to keep shooting the guys in back is often frustrating more than fun. Then there is the problem of an enemy slightly off screen: because this is side-scrolling action, your exit is at the other side and as you fight your way through, it's possible that you will receive the fatal shot by an enemy just beyond your exit.      While the gunplay takes a lot of getting used to, the pace overall brings to mind Hotline Miami. An army of 1-hit enemies with spots of random elements (when they drop their weapons or what weapons they wield), being killed by offscreen enemies, signposting dates,  music that doesn't stop, quick retry after death, receiving instructions for a job to enter a mission, and leaving a mission through a getaway car, all of this seems reminiscent of the indie great, but the similarities don't stop there.  Arguably, one of the standout elements of Hotline Miami was the arthouse portion where the player did some mundane thing and interacted nonviolently with some sort of shop owner. ASB takes this idea and blows it up in all the worst ways. The player is treated to sparse dialogue between the protagonist and his handler, but then they have to wander around doing mundane things for what feels like eternity: the player can take sleeping pills, walk through a museum, ride an elevator, sit in a theater, etc. There really did not seem to be a point to any of these portions. They dragged on forever without characterizing the protagonist or adding to the action. I played through this game in one sitting. Not out of joy, but because I felt like I was being held hostage, worried that if I exited and reentered the game I would have to play through it again. ASB is simply uncompromising in its vision: the lack of ammo count, UI, proper health etc. make every part of the action harder. No guidance for the slice of life portion means the player just walks around aimlessly.  There is definitely a message here; when a new game is started you choose the date on a calendar, the player doesn't know why or how it affects anything but its the opening, one of the most important parts of any story. The dialogue touches on war trauma (possibly Vietnam due to the mention of a chopper, like Hotline Miami), loss, and other things, but it goes nowhere. ASB is not terrible. The sound design and music are great, especially when it cues during a scene for cinematic flair. The flick of a lighter to end a terse conversation, the squeal of the guitar as the shooting kicks, these are great moments. Some of the motifs work really well;at the beginning of the action sequences the player has to raise their weapon and then fire. When the mundane life moments finally end they often melt away sporadically. Even the lack of traditional HUD with health and ammo is cool. But then there is a level where the player can only see the protagonist as he walks by windows. The player is blind for most of it and just has to push through hoping that they make it. Arrest of a Stone Buddha lacks balance. For every empowering run of akimbo pistols and shotguns, they are coupled with dozens of agonizing defeats. The protagonist is a total nihilist, which makes him a tough sell. Even if some of the animation is cool, seeing hundreds of canned death animations gets old. ASB is a moody genius with a lot to say, but I just can't figure out what it's trying to say. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Completed the third part of Tomb Raider. I am disappointed with her. Alas! Achtung, spoilers possible! :-) I'll start with the good. As in the first and second parts, I liked the landscapes, visuals, locations. Normal gameplay, interesting stealth, various challenges, more side missions, a large arsenal, normal crafting of equipment and weapons. Good, celestial characters. The rest left a bad aftertaste. Here's the plot. Weak, boring, no intrigue. Interesting moments are off-screen, like the hunt for Trinity. Misunderstandings about Lara's dad. In part 2, we were convinced that he was out of his skin, quarreled with everyone, wanted to find Kitezh, and here they already declare that he did the same thing to find Paititi. And in the end he was slammed not for Kitezh, but for Paititi. The feeling that the writers could not be determined. Her, maybe I didn't understand what the plot was, well, you too, as storytellers, could try. The gameplay has been reduced mostly to puzzles in tombs and crypts. This is an interesting feature of the entire series, became the will of the developers directly dominant. The first 20 hours I liked everything, but then I began to tire. Yes, and there is a loss of dynamics in the narrative because of them. I also didn't like the chosen culture. This is of course subjective, but I liked the Japanese style from the game of 2013 and the Slavic-Byzantine from the 2nd part much more. Well, somehow I do not have a soul for the Incas, Mayans, Aztecs. Also a bit bored. Even during the game, I could feel the developers' laziness, or something. There are a lot of repetitive elements per square meter :-) Here I am doing a task, as a result, an NPC dies in the cutscene, next to him is his relative, well, one to one dying :-) And then a new task gives the same model, only with a new hairstyle. Even with collectibles were lazy, a huge part of them are copies of each other. I honestly don't remember this in the previous parts. Each item was unique, I looked at them with pleasure, twisted them, twisted them, read their history. But this was not the case, they dropped to the point that there were 4 completely identical things. Nahua you added them ??? Unpleasantly surprised by the bugs with the light. At the junctions of locations, there is always a total illumination. It's like lighting from multiple locations is superimposed on each other. You stand still, turned the camera to the left, a supernova flash, turned the impenetrable darkness to the right. In some areas it is impossible to be, you have to cut the brightness. I'm tired of criticizing the game, remembering its jambs, especially I didn't write them down :-) In general, I really liked the first two parts. And I think that against their background 3, the game is much weaker, as if the developers are tired of doing this project. Even in the ending, there is no hint of new adventures. In general, the game is normal, but I personally, for my subjective taste, did not like it. Hence the thumbs down. But in principle, you can buy, especially if you have the first two parts in the collection! P.S. Larka bust, top !!! :-) ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

I personally require a mouse pad the size of Central Park in order to move the arm around (even on the highest sensitivity).  It's definitely presented as a joke game, not an achievement or skill game, although those things are very much required to get anywhere.  There is no advice or direction in how to approach a given surgery, lots of bloody fun in the trial and error.  Too difficult to grasp objects in general, it can take an eon to get the scalpel in your hand at the right angle for incision.  Certainly not realisitic, and the title \"simulator\" here must be taken with a grain of salt.  Or a salt mine even.          On the positive, I totally knew what I was getting into and got a deal on the game anyway, so it's no travesty that's happened here.  The game really is pretty funny, and that seems to be it's greatest achievement.  I had  dreams of a more balanced mix of sim and parody...but got mostly the latter.            If  the hand were SLIGHTLY more dexterous, I would've enjoyed it more.  I'm sure it must be rewarding for true mouse-keteers that eventually hone their precision with the movements... that seems the only way to advance passed the first surgery even.

{"text": "Good evening. Well, how kind, not really. So he sat down to play cs, everything is fine, but here the unknown, well, you understand. If you started playing CS, be sure to put a valerian or something sedative near you, because this game will not give you a normal life. Cop is a drug. If you came in once and you liked it, then that's it, you will get stuck in it and you will never find a way out of this narcotic, painfully heart-breaking cop. So, I am in this dependence, a little more (as of 01/17/17) 2500 hours. Going into the cop for the first time, I can give advice, turn off the game and then delete (I save your lives). I went in and no one told me what would happen to me. No, I didn't become a fat couch cs expert. I have become addicted to the game and cannot stop. It's sad. The second part of this whole nonsensical review is the attitude of the game towards us and also by all of our favorite game developers. Having entered the game, you will not be able to go to mm and ride with friends, you must definitely reach the mark in the third rank (which was introduced for some unknown reason, apparently they are preparing people for the army), and you have to play in pubs and in other INTERESTING modes. And at this stage you meet people who shoot better than you, but you do not suspect that they are using AI-Ya-Ya, which are bad programs that give them the opportunity to blow up your fart. Okay, let's say you have the hands of God and you get to the point where you can play with your friends, but the next trouble comes! Obviously, your friends are above the level and as luck would have it, there are only four of you in your company! YOU think it's okay, but you are mistaken, you will not be allowed to play igrulyu, sweat that you are a noob and a salaga, not a dad cop (or just your friends have a great rank, but the cop will still lower you to a noob) In this case, I advise you to make new friends and exactly five (please note that there are no people who surrender as soon as the war begins. Haha, funny joke, Poles). Let's talk about the Poles - this nation is \"very kind\" and will treat you like God, oh, shit. You will learn to speak Polish better than you know your language now. Okay, you shouldn't dwell on these people, because if you haven't put together a stack (team), then people are waiting for you who will troll, morally humiliate, interfere with the game, but especially talk about your parents. Well done, you started playing, won the first game, won the second, but you see the inscription \"Dear, let you play in a day\" and when all your friends play further, then you are looking at the timer when you are allowed to play. And imagine, you will have to sit like this five times to wait for this glorious day, when you can play endlessly, until you kill your partner and you will not be banned. Remember that the ban increases if you have a little killer of your friends, or of a Pole. I think you have read this and are no longer playing the game. But what the hell, you continue on! Okay, let's continue. There is such a thing as opening cases, oh, I shouldn't say this, so FORGET! If I see you opening cases, then we will find you and get you in the ass! We pass smoothly to the developers. Yes, these people are great, they try and make good content and updates, but there is one thing ... For you, these updates will not be very good. With each new update, the game gets worse and worse. You want bugs fixed - get new sounds. You want the rank system to be clear - get a case with skins. I understand that you need to feed your family with black caviar in the Maldives, but why can't you do something that can be useful? Okay, my friend, I'm tired of writing this review, it's still useless. I hope you remember that you do not need to play this game, because it will kill you. Pros of the game: you can kill chickens.

The plot of the cooperative mode is simple, in the style of picking up data and bringing it to the point, data that is always in a wild ass and guarded by a bunch of stupid soldiers. The game constantly throws you into the textures (an arm or a leg may get stuck, well, or even completely) In cooperative mode, you may be haunted by out-of-sync in those moments when you do something together (in my case, it was downhill on the ropes). The multiplayer in the game is not bad. There is a division into 2 classes; - spies (you can jump on walls, become invisible and cut people right and left); - mercenaries (soldiers in heavy armor with an assault rifle that can be punched in the face of the enemy at any time), these 2 classes are also divided into several subclasses with different weapons and equipment.

Did you instrumental in me? What is it, when you were born, things like Game of Thrones Melissandre ritual moment come to the hospital in black, you immediately became my child. No. Who are you dog? And the devil of these huge devils commands the baby as much as a hand. Go kill that, go do this, look I will give you strength etc. Don't give my brother power. Will we not be able to live our master lord life? He doesn't see his own business either. Come on, thank you for everything, let's kill it, but let's kill; 1- We do not know what to do at home, we are wandering. We have a notebook, we take note of things like whistles that will not be stuck. Are we detectives, brother? 2- The story does not have a clever scenario, we take down the guys one by one. Worse, we cannot decide who to kill and who to kill. Whatever the devil father says. 3- More importantly, there is only one way to kill. Whatever you discover randomly from now on by wandering around the house. So don't expect a Hitman performance. 4- NPCs caught the disease of dying because of stupidity, somebody got locked in a while, it was a bug, it was constantly telling the same thing, it turned around. is that nice 6- The game engine is disgrace.

Now comes the fun part, the ranked matches are fine, but please add a REPORT SYSTEM.  It is crucial that the game has such features so it will prevent players from LEAVING the match halfway like an idiot.  AND NOW THE FINALE, please PLEASE remove the Capture The Flag MODE.

Please, do something about this.  The end.

{"text": "TL;DR : Singularity Roller is a frustrating \"demo\" made out of default Unreal Engine library assets, which does not worth $0.1, let alone the current steam price of $5. In the name of fairness, let's put everything it has to offer to perspective: --- Positives first (the glass half full section): --- + You control a roller ball with some sort of energy field around it, which \"might\" wow you for the first 10secs + The excitement of having to hunt through a maze for \"something\" -> initial impression + Achievements (I kid you not, 515! TSA points from this! Mind boggling) --- Neutrals to balance it out (the couldn't think of anything else section): --- = Reminds you why spring-cleaning your library off games you will always regret having is important = The need to start SteamVR for no reason at all; why not? (though if you exit SteamVR it still works) = Not saving any options, why have them at all? (added for completeness) = Hardly optimised, with a massive 5.3GB hard disk footprint for a 10-15min demo of a game   (a single resources \"pak\" file is found, named LandscapeMountains - perhaps there is more to it?) --- Negatives for last (no nails or coffins have been hurt in this section): --- - Take a cuboid, hollow it out, add 2 wall cross-sections in it, some steps on the side and ...    call that \"the level\" - Now add a very loose control to a funky roller ball, you know the \"move + jump\" type and ...    call that the \"gameplay\" - Spice it up with 50 other static balls, each for a cool steam achievement of Epic TSA proportions and ...    call that the \"motivation to play\" - Sprinkle it with tons of bugs (how can such a sort game have so many bugs?) and ...    call that the \"challenge\" - Finish it off, with the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance (or cherry on top for some) with the last achievement still being broken    and call that the \"freaking frustration\" ** - Go on steam, pass the approval process and this piece of trash is then called \"a game\" ----- Personally, Singularity Roller infuriated me so much, it actually made me wanna go out, even though we are still under lockdown and risk cv-19, rather than having to spend another second chasing that 50th achievement (for closure). ** As a postscript, I would like to thank @In-sight- for the solution to the 50th cheevo bug, which was by hitting \"K\" when starting and pocketing 48/50 \"non\" roller balls immediately (can't get back the time I spent on it but you are all welcome to use it for sanity's sake) ----- Credit here: ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

Turns out they've removed micro transactions from the game completely, and now you only gain an advantage over other players through playing the game. Overall, it's a 7/10 for me. It's a fun Battlefield game, but the customization doesn't feel as solid as it could be, and some there's not many modes to play. I'd like a couple more types to add to variety, but it's still fun overall. Update! It's 4 months later, and the lobbies are pretty empty. There's usually just one match running, and -surprise surprise- it is full, which means you'll sit in the lobby with a couple others, unable to start because there are not enough players. Considering this issue, I'd have liked to see the developers allow empty lobby slots to be filled by AI players so that you can still play the game on slower nights. Sadly though, the developers have stated the game is exactly what they want it to be at, so no future updates. 4/10 for Dev's imagination, and I do not recommend buying any longer now that the main staple of the game is not playable without getting lucky.

{"text": "Updated: 1 nov. 2017 at 1:14 Unfortunately - no! All the same 800 mb called \"Entertain yourself, my friend, just try.\" Simply put, \"Ctrl + C -> Ctrl + V\". Even the achievements were copied from \"Spintires\" ... .. Yes, they added a camera with a view from the cockpit, I will not argue, atmospheric, even very much. But here is the personification of the dashboard - \u201cI finished only the first year, and even then not completely, I can only make rectangular menus with large buttons. Aha ... \"And the truth, why bother, blinded one for all, and all the cases! Yes, they improved the graphics, but not to say that it was straight \"Ah\" ... Added tests ... The very first test - \"Park the trailer in reverse, with a view from the cockpit.\" And everything would be fine. But the rear-view mirrors were not delivered, they are there, but there is a stupidly muddy texture. And so I apparently have to rely on the \"sixth sense\" when turning back, and thinking where is my trailer, whether it has pulled it into a rut, if I hurt something .. But to cure the painful dislike of the game for the combination of keys \"Alt + Tab \u00bbHands did not reach, still throws it into the main menu after pressing ... And again - Take 8 units of logs to pass the map, and open all the points ... In the first part, everything was blamed on the evil publisher. Let's wait what they will come up with this time to justify their laziness and greed! P.S. For those comrades who claim that the game will be developed, you just need to wait! Let's take a rational look at the situation, and remember how everything happened with \"Spintires\". She was released on June 13, 2014. And even if you believe for a second in that story about an evil publisher: 1. He didn't throw the developer right on the day of release !? Right!? Confirmation of that, those few pathetic patches that managed to come out! 2. 1.1 million copies were sold, I don't count other people's money, and I don't know how much the developer got! But I'm sure he got something. And here's the gist: as soon as \"Spintires\" came out, the players immediately asked to fix the camera, make a view from the cockpit, make support for the rudders, and they asked a lot! The developer fed with \"breakfasts\", promises like: \"Next week there will be a patch!\" but weeks, months passed, and nothing happened. And the last straw of absurdity became when, on New Year's holidays in 2015, the developer releases a free card with the words \"Thank you for your patience and faith in me, here's a New Year's gift for you\", and immediately after the New Year's holidays, this card is taken away, allegedly for revision ... Only now she never returned from there! (Perhaps it was later returned, I don't know, I stopped following the game, deleted it, and forgot) During the period that he was allegedly still working with the publisher (and this is until the new year 2015 for sure), he did not hit his finger on his finger, but only made promises! And how can such a person believe now, believe in his promises ?! The bottom line is simple, you are the customer first and you pay your money for the product. But in the end there is no product as such, there are only promises and tales! And you can think of anything, and an evil publisher, and an evil mother-in-law, a bitchy wife, small children, bad weather, lack of mood)) It's up to you, believe it or not, I issued a refund! As a last resort, if a miracle really happens, and the game really develops and improves, it's never too late to buy it again! ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": false}

All the rest force your paint color and/or texture.  Two of them don';t give you any choices of either color or texture.  Also, I can't control the sound of the engine like on other cars and I don't particularly like the sound of the 4WD car.

{"text": "A simple, mechanically, reaction game. The bottom line is as follows: The player controls the arrow, which flies at great speed along the track, on which obstacles periodically arise. The arrow must dodge obstacles by moving to adjacent tracks. Good thing - each level adds new mechanics. At the same time, the mechanics, although simple, add additional complexity (in a good way) to the game. However, right there it is worth mentioning that there are only 7 levels. The picture is pleasant, albeit minimalistic. It also poses a serious danger to epileptics. Music, although at first seems pretty good and driving, but very quickly becomes boring. Plus, due to some gameplay features associated with a slight acceleration / deceleration of time, it soon starts to seriously cringe from it. There are several game design issues with the game that make the game feel like it's not always fair, which shouldn't be the case in a hardcore reaction game. The player must always clearly understand that it is he who is to blame for the loss, and not the game. Problem # 1: Delay between entering commands when moving between tracks. After accepting a command to move to an adjacent track, the arrow cannot be immediately sent to the next adjacent track. There is a small gap in command entry. It feels like the game needs to complete its movement animation. Although the animation is short, at the speed of the game, even a fraction of a second is a criminal lot. Problem # 2: Tilting the camera towards special obstacles. We have to admit that this problem grows from the quite correct idea that the player should be very clear about what exactly is required of him now. In the game, gradually, special obstacles appear: Blue, which need to be flown only from a certain direction, and green, which do not need to be flown. The camera always clearly shows a new special obstacle so that the player can always see it. However, the problem here is the speeds at which this game takes place. Because of them, such sudden camera turns very much disorient the player. Problem # 4. Excessive feedback. There are several events in the game that are accompanied by feedback - an increase in the speed of the track, and the destruction of the enemy by the player. Basically, as in the case of the last paragraph, the roots of this problem grow from the correct idea that the player must be very clear about what exactly happened. And, in principle, the game copes with this. But there is a nuance. The fact is that as soon as one of these events occurs, time slows down for a split second. And in some situations, this is quite enough to get off the usual rhythm and jump to the next lane too early, which often leads to a collision. Also, another gameplay problem is associated with this feedback - the fact is that the control at this moment is blocked for the same fraction of a second, which is why the player also periodically gets out of rhythm. To summarize, I can neither advise this, nor, on the contrary, refuse the recommendation. This negative analysis should be rather neutral, but Steam does not provide such an opportunity. For those who want to kill some time in a hardcore arcade game for reactions, it is suitable. But you need to be prepared for the fact that she may not seem entirely honest.

{"text": "\"Push The Crate\" was clearly inspired by the classic \"Sokoban\". But instead of having to move boxes to the correct position in a warehouse as a warehouse worker, you play a gentleman dressed in medieval clothes who has to move boxes to certain fields in a clearing in an area closed by fences. Since the game can be controlled from a classic bird's eye view but also from the so-called \"3rd person\" perspective, it looks very modern and gives the impression of great graphics in the main menu. But some things don't look good to look at, especially from a bird's eye view: The lighting is too bright even at the highest graphics setting, shadows look unrealistic and the textures look very blurry. But graphics aren't everything; For me personally, besides having fun, the soundscape and background music is more important. The game can score a lot with atmospheric background noise and several medieval music. The music is chosen randomly at each level so that you don't always have to listen to the same music. It is controlled using the a, s, w, d keys, although unfortunately you cannot use the arrow keys as an alternative or even change the key assignment. This is a big flaw because I personally prefer to use the arrow keys. Unfortunately, the game also has deficits in the most important aspect: Moving the boxes is very error-prone and inaccurate. Sometimes a little nudge moves the box one field further and another time it rushes to the nearest fence. If you are unlucky and that is often the case in this regard, the box even ends up on the other side of the fence and is therefore no longer accessible. Due to these circumstances, solving the level is a pure game of chance and you often have to start it again. It is extremely frustrating when you think you have found the solution to a level, but it is difficult or impossible to put into practice because of the faulty box movements. (One wonders why this was not noticed during testing! After all, this error can appear in the first level!) At the end it should be said that even the achievements are not free from errors: While some can be unlocked quite normally, you get some without having fulfilled the requirements or vice versa, despite the achievement of the requirement the achievement remains open. In short: A \"Sokoban\" implementation that seems very promising at first glance disappoints in particular with unnecessary errors and a lack of free key assignment, which in the end only brings frustration instead of fun and in no way justifies a purchase without rework.

{"text": "To quote Yngwie Malmsteen, \"how can less be more? More is more\"... I love puzzles. I love gorgeous indie artwork and stories about friendship. So how did this game make me want to stab my own eyes out with a fork? 1. The story. Our two characters are wordless, and the reward at the end of each level is pretty much a still of them hanging out. I found it boring, and that's coming from someone who plays a lot of visual novels/walking simulators. 2. The speed. If a game is to be based entirely around rewinding time, PLEASE for the love of god let me do it more quickly than this. It feels like the slow walking speed has been implemented on purpose to stop you realising how short the game actually is. 3. The puzzles Puzzle difficulty is inconsistent. I feel like good game design leads you into understanding the mechanics before forcing you to try a harder version of the same, whereas this game asks you to just walk around more, ignoring the tools you have, until you solve the level almost by accident. 4. The music I muted it a few mins in because the ETERNAL string notes underneath everything felt \"busy\". 5. That pricetag.

Another thing is that I have adopted pets in the past and they always end up getting stuck and the simmers cannot figure out how to take care of them by themself, its really frustrating since they get taken away really quickly, there just isnt enough content in this DLC to justify the price tag.

{"text": "I joined this Free Weekend and it was the following: 3 Brazilian Servers. I found 1 player in the entire time I played on Full server. The two times I died it was for the same reason: hunger and thirst. If you try to survive by eating only healthy food, you will not find enough. If you eat what is necessary, the character gets drama, gets infection and keeps vomiting to exclude from the body the only food you found in kilometers. So, really top the character on the screen. The graphics of the character in the inventory is really cool but you can't accept that you can't wear a bandanna with a motorcycle helmet but you can drink water without taking off that helmet ... First time I died because I couldn't find food in the city I was in (and he was a countryman, it was an obligation not to have someone pass by and loot the entire city *), just as I drink water from the stream made the character become infected and burst into infection, spewing all the food he didn't have. And the second death was me getting hungry extremely fast for no reason (I spawned the night, at dawn my character was hungry), got Human Steak and set up the diabolical bonfire (what a ridiculous crafting is that? Throw a shitload of random item on the floor and then assemble, plate, wood and fire is necessary in life). I was able to cook but not before I had to put out the suffering fire to be able to remove the food (?) And then finally eat, so that after 10 seconds the character would be hungry again, so I ate another piece of meat and the character again got infected. He threw up what little he had and died. kkk so like, very good the \"vibe\" (in 2012 it was a good vibe, nowadays no more) but anything else, this game fails.

{"text": "This review may only be temporary. Here's hoping. NOTE: If you're wondering about playtime, It's because I'm a heavy user of offline mode. Always-on DRM strikes again. So I finally downloaded the full retail version after playing the open beta and decided to play through the story mode before going back into multi. It gave me a choice of six options for how I wanted my Warden to look. I picked one with armor I didn't really like since it has a symbol that I did like, only to get in game and find that it didn't even use the symbol it had shown me. Seems simple enough, I'll just go back and pick the armor I liked the look of then. Or not. After looking around the ingame menus for a while I came to the conclusion that there isn't any way to change the appearance you picked at the start. Anywhere. OK, so I'll just restart story mode from the beginning. Or not. There's no ingame option to start a \"New Game\". Anywhere. OK, then I'll just go find my save data and delete it. Problem solved. Or not. After searching extensively through every folder I've ever seen games save to, users, steam\\userdata, local, roaming, ubisoft game launcher, my documents, my saves, etc. and doing several searches across multiple hard drives, all I came up with were two ini files for graphics and control options. I even searched through my registry. So I figured I'd ask on a forum. Surely someone on the internet must have found the save location. Or not. After getting a few suggestions of places I already checked, someone came in and said it was probably stored in the cloud. I thought to myself, \"surely not\", as I have cloud saving disabled in both Steam and Uplay and always have. And I'm only looking for the single player save file, not the multiplayer one. I'll simply set both Steam and Uplay to offline mode and prove that the saves must be located somewhere on my local machine. Or not. The game won't even launch if Uplay is in offline mode. So it appears that random forum user was correct. I'll have to contact Ubisoft support to get this resolved. Surely they can reset my save, or failing that, it should be a simple matter to just delete it so I can start over. Or not. After waiting over five hours in line, I finally got to chat with a human being who could actually do something about this. Or not. According to my support agent, Ubisoft in incapable of changing my characters appearance, or of even deleteing my single player save game. And they have no plans to add such a feature. So in conclusion, the unnecessary use of always-on DRM for the single player portion of the game, combined with the ridiculous omission of a simple way to change your character or even to start a new game from scratch, combined with slow and unhelpful customer support means I have to give this a negative rating for the time being. And that's without even getting into the pay-to-not-grind aspects of the multiplayer, or the connectivity issues and hassles trying to get friends to actually be able to join the same game, etc. Or the price. Here's hoping they fix this and I'm eventually able to focus more on the gameplay and multiplayer issues rather than dealing with idiotic feature omissions, bad tech support, and always-on DRM.
