{"text": "It is a great satisfaction to see Destiny 2 coming here on Steam and, even more, for bringing much of its content as \"Free-to-Play\". We have a much larger and more active community here, including veterans and new players! And despite the chaos that was its \"relaunch\" here, it is already much more stable and normalized. It is indeed F2P, but to some extent, isn't it? The new content will be paid for. But I assure you that there is so much to do and explore that you will have an excellent experience and guaranteed fun before you even consider reaching the contents of the new expansions. So much that it can be quite confusing for new players. Today the game has a new dynamic and is practically all focused on multiplayer cooperation and its journeys, leaving the campaign as an option. They called this new format \"The New Light\". This pleased a good part of its players, but not everyone is 100% satisfied (it will be a matter of getting used to it). I'll try to summarize what, at least, I thought was worth highlighting in this change: are you a new player? If you care,. You will not regret! Run after Amanda Holiday and unlock one campaign at a time and proceed. At least the first: \"The Red Legion\". It is a very interesting adventure, very fun and offers excellent content, I guarantee! It is simply an experience that every Destiny 2 player has to experience at least once. In addition, it will present all the characters, enemies and mechanics of the game in a natural way (except that you will already have all the skills at your disposal). After that, you will have the Destiny universe in your hands and you can get a bullet through everything and everyone in the name of the Traveler. is a Shooter with RPG elements focused on frantic action with rain of bullets from all sides. And with very well implemented mechanics, by the way, because the control of movement and shooting will be dominated naturally by you during gameplay without great difficulties .. the detail that differs how each one will play is given by which class of character choose, because each has a certain peculiarity. And, no joke: the game is visually VERY BEAUTIFUL .. you will find yourself admiring the scenery several times. In addition, the game is full of memorable characters and impeccable voice acting for our native language. Speaking of, quickly, the story revolves around the \"Traveler\". An entity that brought life and prosperity to everything its light reached, for centuries ... considered a divine being by those who live under its guard. That was until the beginning of Destiny 2 and before all the content it throws in your chest. The campaign itself lasts approximately 10 hours, apart from the two expansions \"The Curse of Osiris\" and \"The Warlike Mind\" that can deliver another 5h ~ 6h of gameplay, and that's all free, not to mention of the time you will spend \"playing\" around the places exploring some small areas of interest, carrying out Sidequests, annihilating aliens and participating in public events that occur during the maps from time to time ... in short, the \"farm\" itself. It is possible for you to go over 60 hours and not even notice. But, if you are not interested in the campaign, there is no lack of post-game content here. There are several events that can be explored, but the main ones are, quite briefly: In the end, know that they will end up becoming repetitive. But until you start to get sick, you will experience a lot of epic things. So, if you just want to have fun, this new journey from Bungie here on Steam offers a full plate for a lot of people who want high quality content without having to pay a penny ... either for those who care about the campaign or not. But again, I strongly recommend following the campaign! The new content Forsaken and Shadowkeep bring very interesting content and, if you liked what you were, I recommend purchasing it at a favorable opportunity for you. In addition, this was a game that offered me a very rewarding experience, guaranteeing hours and hours of fun and I didn't even play \"for real\".

The first thing that caught my attention is the artistic design of it, full of completely straight lines, something that personally seems to me to be even a step ahead of the term \"minimalist\". The music is somewhat curious, a kind of film soundtrack from the 1920s; Although it is not bad and there are times when it does not even sound, it accompanies quite well. As for what comes to the heart of the game (that is, the puzzles), fortunately they are quite consistent and are not crazy inventions as in others. It is marked by humor, although it is too short to become fond of the character enough. As an extra, it includes a mini-adventure (yes, more so) about one of the secondary characters. In general you could say that it is good to hang out. The base price seems excessive to me, it would be more interesting to wait for an offer or pack with the continuation.

{"text": "This is an assessment of the campaign  Starting off with the technical aspects Doesn't seem like much was done to improve the original. I still get tearing on my G-Sync monitor so I had turn put on fast sync to avoid it entirely and there is still no FOV slider for campaign that is but as far as graphical presentation, there is clearly a descent upgrade. Much more colourful and vibrant colours as supposed to the constant greys and browns on the original but this game weirdly enough, has reasons why it's a good sequel and why it isn't.  This is up for you to decide campaign-wise starting off with the negatives:  1) Game play in this one felt far more directed towards action which inevitably hurt the series later down the road  2) Game play also felt repetitive. Every encounter was just me or other men killing hoards and hoards of solider's again and again and again which did happen in the original but far less frequently to this.  3) Some very important and interesting dialogue told while your in game on the battlefield, making it quite hard sometimes to focus on two things at the same time.  Now on why it is a better sequel: 1) Clearly better and more memorable soundracks  2) More interesting villains 3) More twists I do like just how bombastic and in your face it is with its story and the twist with shepherd was alright but I wouldn't say its campaign earns it legendary status like its multiplayer does and with how repetitive the game play loop was for me I can't rate it any higher the the original. So I'll give it an 8/10. I completed the campaign in just about 5 hours on the dot which is roughly the same as original so I would advice you to get this game cheap as well if you aren't into the multiplayer. Also shepherd I felt also had an anticlimactic ending just like Zakhaev's which kinda disappointed me also but since they don't really focus on the campaign on these types of games to begin with, I guess I can't really expect well flushed characters to begin with. I call them surface level villains. They have also seemed to have fixed all my minor gripes in the original which were quite problematic which I guess is a bonus.

{"text": "In today's seemingly distant two thousand and eleventh year, the little-known studio Zachtronics Industries released the game SpaceChem, which can literally be translated as Space Chemistry. What happens infrequently, the name completely conveys the essence: we have to do chemistry in space (not in the open, of course, but not on Earth) as a young engineer, namely, to program processes in molecular reactors, and sometimes even build small production complexes . I think, already at this moment it becomes clear that SpaceChem is not an action, not a quest or even a graphic novel, SpaceChem is a very harsh and hardcore puzzle, but first things first. Let's start with the plot. He is, and meets us with the phrase \"You know, people die in space\", which sets the general tone for the whole story. The plot here is essentially a medium-sized short story that connects levels and reveals a classic parable about the menacing majesty of the unknown and the fragility of the person who encounters this unknown. Pretty pleasant reading, framed by small sketches. But the salt of the game is far from history. It's time to talk about the gameplay itself. Most of the time, the player watches a ten-by-eight board. On this board, he programs two lines - red and blue. When the reactor starts, manipulators start running along the lines, which, when passing through the cells marked by the player, perform various actions - they capture and throw, connect, rotate molecules of various substances (new teams appear later). The goal is to obtain molecules of other substances from the molecules of some substances that appear in the left half of the reactor through transfers and transformations, and then send them to the right half. And you need to program the reaction scheme so that it runs for several tens of cycles. It seems to me that it is rather difficult to describe game mechanics clearly, or I just can't do this, so I'll give a small analogy. The gameplay of SpaceChem is like solving a problem in a technical subject: computer science, physics, geometry, and the like. There is a clearly stated condition. There is a certain device that allows you to perform various operations. And most importantly, there is room for creativity. The gameplay of most games of this genre is to find the answer conceived by the authors. Here, there is no clear-cut framework for how to solve the proposed problem. Most of the SpaceChem levels can be completed in dozens, if not hundreds of different ways, and the emotions from the next successfully completed reaction are the same as from finding a solution to the very system of diffours that has been haunting for a couple of days. The emphasized cold and minimalistic design just creates the feeling that I'm sorry, you didn't come here to be entertained, but to engage in a business that requires a serious approach and concentration. In the stages with the construction of chemical plants, the game becomes even more complicated, forcing you to think in a slightly different plane and decide for yourself which molecules and in what order to load into the reactors, laying piping systems and choosing where to place the reactors. It is impossible not to mention the complexity. With a sufficiently high entry threshold, SpaceChem does not slow down throughout its entire length and constantly throws up increasingly complex and more non-trivial tasks, and at the end brazenly selects nights spent trying to at least find the right course of the reaction. A sort of Dark Souls puzzle world. In conclusion, I note that everyone who wants to stretch their brains loves games of this genre, interesting tasks and severe challenges, SpaceChem is simply recommended, unless of course you have heard of it before. The rest, I believe, does not make much sense to get acquainted with this game, and the plot can be read on the Internet. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "okay so i just got this game today and there are many pros and cons that i have run into when playing this game. first off i've only played though it once with ruby's character and a little bit with blake's i do have to say that the campaign was a little shorter than i had expected. i know that this is still in development and that the campaign is only a third or forth of the actual game, but with the knowledge that i've played through this once in 1.3 hours with only 1 partner to help out and you multiply that by the other 4 parts you're only getting a first playthrough of about 5.2 hours so this seems a little concerning with how short that seems to be. and i know it seems petty especially with the fact that you can play through 4 different times right now with all of team rwby and easily turn that to almost 21 hours. it still just seems a little short though i would recommend a single playthrough to be put to a least 6 to 7 hours. most of the gameplay was good and the leveling up system worked well but at the moment it still seems a little barebones on the leveling system and i feel like when i level up the new abilities or enhanced ones seem to not change too highly from the previous ones. the voice acting was great and the story kept me going for a bit and i am still invested into finding out what happens in the full game. the couple of bugs that i did find were minimal but bothered me just a bit. there was one when i would pick up a hidden piece and the enemies would stop for a few seconds and their life bars would dissappear so i couldn't kill them in this time. the other one was when i would jump over enemies and my character would freeze up and not move until a used a special move or attacked a few times in a row. the graphics and stylized rwby series animation when perfect in this game and neither of them dropped in quality or caused my game to drop in framerate on ultra settings. oh and one last small thing when you get knocked down i think the timer should be shortened from 45 seconds to 30 seconds since a lot of the time my teammates where stuck fighting and it became tedious to wait for that long. so just to recap: pros: -great characters -great settings -amazing sound quality -great gameplay -amazing graphics -investing story -i love the rwby show and game now a lot so this game gets an A cons: -minor bugs -gameplay is a bit short -not a lot of characters -barebones upgrade system -long death timer reccomendations: -lengthen the story a bit -add more leveling to the upgrade system that feels like there are actual changes going on -add a bigger cast of characters (probably teams JNPR, CFVY, and the headmasters ozpin, glinda, qrow, and ironwood) -shorten the timer to 30 seconds -and this one was a bit on the side but a customization system could work well as well. almost all of the maion characters have had at least one or 2 suit changes so that could be something to probably make worth of the hidden pieces. if to find so many as one character you get a new outfit as well. just rolling off of my head here. all in all i like this game and i see a lot of potential for the future. i give it an 8/10. happy game making!!!!!!

If in the last part we wandered only in the psychiatric hospital on the island, then in this one the city is open to us. When it comes to Harley Quinn's Revenge, we all remember how the main game ended. The Joker is dead, and his main fan, Harley Quinn, cannot bear the loss. She wants revenge on the batman. She manages to kidnap him and take him prisoner. In this add-on, we first play for Robin, free the batman and play for the batman. The goal is to neutralize, capture and put the main criminal, that is, Harley Quinn, in a mental hospital. On the way, breaking a bunch of noses, jaws and limbs of Harley's assorted henchmen. The game, as always, is divided into the search for evidence, fights with a bunch of bandits and the quiet neutralization of armed opponents. Overall a good addition to the main game.

{"text": "I've been trying games of this sort for a few days now and I have to say that 'Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan' is my favorite so far. One of the games I have tried is GL: The Forsaken Bride but I really liked this one better, everything from the soundtrack (which is amazing), storyline, characters was very well thought out. In GL2: Song of the Dark Swan, you are a healer summoned by the king to check on the health condition of his queen. Without giving it away, let's just say that you end up getting more than what you signed up for ehehe. The story is interesting, much more than the Forsaken Bride, more so, that at some point you even feel sorry for what is happening to some of the characters and that is something that I didn't feel while playing FBride. The minigames/puzzles are quite similar to the one's on FBride so you won't feel much difficulty there if you managed to do them on the previous game. However, If my memory serves me, I think there are a few that are a bit different but still doable. As I mentioned before the soundtrack is beautiful, it gives a special touch to the story and makes it even more amazing and captivating. The artwork is fantastic, the characters are wonderfuly presented with nice details.  Oh and lets not forget the little helpers! On the Dark Swan they are super cute and, of course, you'll get more than one. For those of you who don't know, on Grim Legends games you usually have little guys that help you advance in the story (don't worry they don't work as hints or cheats, etc). The only thing that I liked a bit more on the Forsaken Bride than on Dark Swan was the Bonus Content. I felt that on FB it worked better as a continuance of the main story and I didn't felt that with the DS bonus content. If you like games like this then I suggest buying it, being it in a bundle, on sales or at regular price, it's well worth the purchase :) ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "SNK can be said to be a piece of self-releasing work in various senses. It is a combination of sex transfer Terry, women's Iori, and a bunch of pro-daughters. To tell you clearly, this is a fan-oriented work. The threshold is extremely low, innovative fighting mechanism, and various props. Of course, the most important thing is that there are waifu, and it will be very fun to play with your friends. The system of this game is relatively simple. Although it is shallower and less competitive than the classic fighting system, the innovative part of the system is still very interesting and entertaining (see all kinds of spoofs in the game, props, Obviously, this work is for entertainment). The entertaining positioning also means that the threshold of this game is not high. The game cancels the upper, middle and lower attacks, no squatting posture, and the defense is button defense. The ordinary actions of a character only have three kinds of light and heavy casting, and each action has a button. The special actions are kills, super kills and substitutions. There are also three buttons, all of which are one-click moves. Even a novice who has not been exposed to fighting games can play cool combos with a little practice. . The innovation of the game is that the resource energy in the game and HP share an upper limit, and all nirvana releases need to consume energy to release, HP will not be judged in the end, and the game must require super nirvana to end the opponent. , This leads to the importance of resource management in the game, otherwise it will often be found that the opponent is out of blood, and there is no resource to overtake the situation. This mechanism is still a bit interesting, but unfortunately this game is just a tad stop, and there is no in-depth development of the gameplay. Fighters should know that the most uncomfortable thing about the King of Fighters 14 is that it is three years behind the industry's picture level. Therefore, the game is from the same clan and the same source. If you are looking at the picture, players should not expect too much. The original picture can be blown up, but change If you become a 3D model, your interest will plummet, and you can barely accept it by relying on love to beautify in your brain (probably), but it is slightly better than the King of Fighters 14. Therefore, although the game has a dressing system, the player may not have it at all. If you are interested in playing and fighting warmly, it is better to find a professional clothing manufacturer. In addition, it may be due to the SNK heroine fighting, the whole game is too girlish, all kinds of attacks will be accompanied by star special effects like kirakira, the main male players like it or not, mainly because there are too many special effects, making the screen too messy Now, it has reached the point where it affects the visual experience. I hope you will pay attention to it. Matching with the picture, although the music is also in the style of the girl Mary Su, it is really good to listen to. The game itself has only 14 playable characters. It is a bit shabby for SNk. There are too few characters. It is easy to see that the model resources are the materials of the King of Fighters 14 directly. This also shows that SNK is really out of money. KOF15, Samurai Samurai is still understandable. In other respects, to be honest, there are relatively few gameplay in the game, only story mode, computer battle, survival mode and online battle. The story of the game can only be said to come up with a headshot. All the female characters team up and are trapped in the castle by a sand metamorphosis to play \"Chicken Eating\". There is nothing in the plot that can be studied or impressive. The only interesting thing is to pass the level. After the stalk hidden in the dialogue between different characters, Ending, players who understand will smile when they see it. A big problem with the story mode is that the AI \u200b\u200bdifficulty setting is not reasonable. Before the BOSS, all opponents are wooden stakes, but when they reach the Boss level, they are suddenly promoted to a 100% confirmed master, which makes the player very uncomfortable. The game does add the standard gameplay of fighting games: computer battle and survival mode, but there is no arcade mode, which is a pity (cut corners). For online battles, you comrades basically don't need to think about it. If there is no one on the ghost server, if there are no offline conditions, I think PVP can only be played online. Since there is no small partner in the online situation, it cannot be tested. Although there are various problems, old players of the King of Fighters can still try. After all, SNK has been very unsatisfactory over the years, so you should support SNK. Fortunately, SNK slowed down. Seeing Samurai Samurai in Unreal 4, my worries about the King of Fighters 15 can be put down anyway. Even if you don\u2019t catch a cold for this, everyone can still pay attention to the wave of Samurai Hyuno that will be released on June 27 (ps4). For many years of new work, the current quality of news can still be guaranteed. Please pay attention to more game recommendations ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Think Vaka Game Magazine (hereafter referred to as VGM) should be considered a newcomer publisher just a year ago. I never thought that it is now the leader of the famous story adventure game in the industry. No, the popularity of \"Battered Noelle\" and \"Angel of Killing\" has not passed yet, and VGM has quickly opened a new pit \"Arnie Incident Book\". It has to be said that VGM has found its own way of survival in a large number of two-dimensional games today. Although the game has injected a lot of suspense, puzzle solving, adventure, fantasy, and puzzle solving elements, it is essentially selling The character and plot, coupled with the agency's long-term capture of details such as pictures, sound effects, and easter eggs, have resulted in a self-contained style. It feels like playing, which not only satisfies the curiosity of many players to understand the puzzle, but on the other hand, the puzzle itself is not difficult, which reduces the player's frustration and brain burn. It is stressful in everyone's life and work. Today, it is really a very pleasing setting. When VGM was preparing for the release of ``Arnie Event Book'', it can be said to be very playful and attracting attention. As early as in major publicity platforms and forums, a large number of serial four-frame comics written by Mr. Harutaro were released. If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, I suggest you go find it and take a look before you play. It\u2019s pretty careful and contains a lot of content. Most of the plots are funny and cute, and various funny little clips show up. From this point of view, this work is already slightly better in the publicity stage. In addition, new improvements in reasoning have been publicized, and a large number of \"intrinsic reasoning\" has been adopted, which can help the studio broaden the fan circle. Japanese benign reasoning is really good, but it has been slightly lacking in recent years. Like the Detective Conan series, there are more and more suspicions of modular and routine operation, while the Jintian series are relatively lacking in domestic introduction and some animations have made this work. If you can inject a fresh blood of inferential reasoning, it's hello and me, everyone is happy... But the result... VGM, you should honestly sell the character and plot, don't talk about the original reasoning, otherwise The planning is really likely to be knocked by fans. As for the suppression of the coffin board of Mr. Edogawa Ranbu... Your follow-up works can do well, and we fans will do more. In short, really don't treat \"The Arnie Event Book\" as a basic reasoning, or even treat it as a rigorous reasoning work. If the player is looking at the character and the plot, then I can tell you that the performance of this work is particularly good, not only the protagonists, Arnie Nittat and Lin Rheinweiss, but also the impressive characters. The supporting roles are also distinctive and lovable. Not to mention many details of the story and the process. The atmosphere is very well created. Although there are not so many tragic and joyous in the end, the various ups and downs in the process still make the players addicted. Just play a serious adventure game. The plot background of this work starts with the hostess Lin. On the one hand, she has just worshipped and played with her mother's grave, but on the other hand, her father still does not recognize the death of her mother; on the other hand, the maid in the family talks about the manor Many men went out at night to be murdered bizarrely, but the housekeeper interrupted the maid. The frustrated and perplexed Lin returned to her room and looked at a record of the Vampire King like a little girl who chased the stars. And when she really met her idol Arnie later, an adventure that was somewhat horrified, but actually better than the story began. The picture in this work well inherits the style of the agency, which is very similar to the handwritten two-dimensional painting, and the Chinese translation part has been further improved compared with the previous two works, making the entire game in the hands of Chinese players. Got to put it down even more. Moreover, there are many elements in the game, such as escape and limited-time dialogue, which also adjusts the rhythm of the game to a certain extent, giving players more sensory stimulation; hamster party players will also find many collections that are not related to the main line in the process. It can be said that multiple levels meet the needs of players. In general, although this game has failed its own propaganda in reasoning, but apart from the reasoning part, when it comes to the performance of all aspects of the game, it is actually very remarkable. As a two-dimensional adventure game, it is actually still a very exciting high-score masterpiece. It is highly recommended for the plot party and human-based party player experience.

{"text": "Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop (ASRD) is a top-down team-co-op shooter. To me the game feels as if it's based off the movies: There is a mission to be executed, and your teams job is to get it done. Missions vary across a wide spectrum. I classify the game as an action/adventure/thriller/sci-fi with a dash of comedy (if playing with other qualified players). It's not scary like the alien movies don't worry. ASRD is a team-strategy game. Teams can be up to a size of 8, with 4 different classes. Tech, Officer, Medic, and Special Weapons. Each class has specializations, and each of the 8 marines has a unique skill load-out. All 8 marines have strengths and weaknesses that fit in with each of the other 7 marines in a very nice complementary way. This is not obvious when first playing the game. Unfortunately, new players do not mix well with seasoned veterans of the game, at all. The exceptions become loved players. Add the fact that there isn't a large pool of active players, noobs DO play on servers with veterans. So, because the game has a noticeable learning curve, most people end up giving up and quitting the game. Ironically, one thing that makes the game very lovable is how much control it gives to the player in the game. There are numerous ways to do the same thing, allowing players to express their creative style in a remarkable way. Again, this is not obvious when first playing the game. There is no real story to the game, nor about the aliens. Most if not all maps have pda's lying around with emails, news, and stuff of the sort, but doesn't tie across from campaign to campaign. I personally like how they didn't add a story. It makes sense with the rest of the game. The controls are simple. Players can add buttons to do things to make the game more enjoyable and things more convenient, from binding keys to show you need health/ammo, to binding keys for quick restarts (asw_restart_mission). The fact that there isn't a real story is good because it allows the opportunity for it to be added in the future. Better no story and more of a focus on the game itself. In conclusion, the game is a 10/10. This isn't changed by the fact that there aren't a lot of players, because if you play the game, and ever need help with anything, there is always some sort of wiki or community discussion thread that elaborates on things beyond what you were looking for. There is a ridiculous contrast between the quality/content of the game, versus the player base. Highly recommended. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

The game feels like it's a mix of Borderlands meets Enter the gungeon judging from the guns mostly as they are rated by their rarity and their remade to fit the furturistic asthetic where robots have gone crazy and their now running some sort of apocalypse. The only I wish was an option was to turn off purchased researches like the gun variants or the ability to lower the chance of getting specific upgrade variants for guns similar to the supply hack because I'm not really a big fan of bullets being printed into a gun especially when ammo isn't a problem for me. Apart from that I am satisfied with what the game has to offer and I greatly encourage the developers to add more content to the game like more guns or possibly game modes or classes.

{"text": "This game is one of the better RPGMaker games I have played although it has a few flaws.  You take on the role of Alice on a quest to save her sick mother by finding the Elohim Cube. You start your journey from a cave in the bottom of a mountain and you fight your way through various landscapes ranging from a icy palace to a volcanic cavern. Battles take place in real time with a cooldown bar between each action. The game has a mix of puzzle solving along with platforming at times. Although the game may have been rebalanced as of now, when I played this game, I was unable to find a spell that was crucial to beating the first boss and I thought certain enemies and bosses needed some rebalancing. I did enjoy what I played of the game though and in my opinion the universe of this game is well thought out.

{"text": "Total War: Rome II - Caesar in Gaul DLC It goes without saying that you like history if you're playing a Total war game. But if you're particularly intrigued by Roman history, the Caesar in Gaul DLC concentrates on a very specific period of time, 58-51 BC. You can command hordes of barbarians to bring the Roman Empire to its knees, or conquer the savages yourself for Rome's glory. There's also some nordic factions to play as if you desire a different approach. The map is zoomed in to Western Europe, including all of Germany, France, England, Italy and Scandinavia, so it has a tight focus. Each turn is two weeks, to account for the short time span of the DLC. + There are different buildings and units for each faction in this DLC which is nice. Weather now plays a crucial role in combat, with freezing conditions causing the deaths of thousands during winter months if they are sieging or traversing the wilderness. Dry summers can affect food production negatively. In addition, there are minor changes to the map of Western Europe, with more regions and greater complexity. + Some changes have been made to how battle commanders function. In Caesar in Gaul, you control legendary leaders from history who will take up the mantle against your foes - Vercingetorix for Gaul or Julius Caesar for Rome, among others. Each have unique traits which impact their ability to influence soldiers and win engagements. - While Caesar in Gaul kept my attention and made some revitalising alterations, none of these should have been left out of the base game in the first place. Seasonal weather effects weren't included in Total War: Rome II (we had this in Total War: Shogun 2) so this is lazy game design. The commander modifications could and should have been part of the base game too. Most of the new features didn't take much effort for Creative Assembly to produce. Still, it's a good DLC and fun.

(27 Nov, 2017 @ 10:02am) The game looks like it was originally designed for single player. Playing the game with just keyboard and mouse may discourage a lot of people so it is recommended to use a controller. Solving the puzzles to advance into the game is fun. Playing local-coop adds more fun. However, because of the extra player, you'll be able to advance through a lot of puzzles without really solving them, it makes the game a lot easier because the stage is not adjusted for co-op. A lot of people may not like the game because of the controls, you have to control the left and right hand individually and the camera is tied to your movement; you'll be looking up to reach things and then be looking down while climbing. Some extras about the game are the easter eggs, some alternate/absurd ways to advance through the puzzles, and customizable look/color for the character. People with no local-coop partners requested for online multiplayer and the devs added it as a free update. This is why I had it voted for a steam award. The online multiplayer support for this game features 8 players and that breaks the default games stages. With this, I hope they add more stages designed for co-op. Workshop support would also help the game a lot so players can make their own stages and have it designed to be solved by 2, 3 or 4 players. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

On the other hand, the game based on the enemy there is a large number of different enemies (The error is to present almost all of them in chapter one, then it is lost because they are repetitive), one or the other if it scares you the way they come out, but that's If none of them presents a challenge, since artificial intelligence is very bad, I think the developer wanted to put the enemies fast and let us move like crazy so that you can't hit them, but that means that at least one of each race they buguen haha. The enemies are ugly and I don't say it because they are scary, but because it seems that someone drew a sketch of those that we make on the back of any notebook and thus, as it is, I attach it to the game haha \u200b\u200bThe big fault that I found in the game is Not being able to see your state of life, it is quite frustrating because you do not know how much life you have, it does not warn you if you are about to die or the red screen turns, simply nothing, between your shots a lot of enemies simply die. Controls are typical of shoter more of the spatial horror hahaha others could mark that the lack of a map is another problem but it seems fine to me, lose yourself for a while and stop going from a point A to a B, it is not that you have many roads. .. As for the sound, the initial voice will be the only thing to listen to for moments and a spatial tune and that's it. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Darkarta is an interesting HOG, leaning on Indian-style mythology, which is a nice change of pace from most of the European-centric games that dominate this genre. Overall, it's an above-average game for the genre, but still features a few flaws. The good:   - while they are of the style we've come to expect from the hidden object genre of games, I find the graphics in Darkarta to be more interesting than average with great use of lighting and color. The cut-scene animations are also very strong, and much more fluid than most other HOGs.  - you will get your money's worth from this game...there is a ton of content, and playtime is 1.5X-2X what you get from your average HOG  - for the most part, they are beautifully rendered and more interesting than many puzzles in this genre with a couple of exceptions (a notable one named in the \"bad\" section).  - excellent throughout The bad:  - Now, I actually think the issue is more the latter than the former. The voice actors were doing what they were asked to do with the script they had. But holy stay-at-home-mom-with-no-romance-in-her-life, Batman! There is SO much melodrama every time the protagonist goes to talk about her little girl that she's trying to rescue that you'll wish that you were playing on mute by the time you get halfway through the story. The dialog is just a schlocky, gooey, godawful \"I will do anything to save you, sweetie\" gag-fest all around. You love your kid. We get it. Stop barking about it non-stop and get to saving her, lady.  - I found a couple, but the most obvious was the puzzle where you have to create patterns under water in the pool...nothing would trigger the check for the puzzle being solved unless you stayed under water until you ran out of oxygen. Then, it would trigger the check and move on. These are things that should be caught during play-testing.  - there are a couple of places where you go to inspect an area and a detail graphic pops up. However, you're actually expected to look through several scenes in this pop-up...but the only indicator are arrows at the edges and they're not particularly obvious. I spent a lot of time wandering around, trying to figure out how to trigger any kind of further event before I realized that there was more content in these. Given that there are achievements for completing the game within a time limit, this sort of thing is frustrating. Make the navigation more obvious and intuitive.  - Seriously, the protagonist falls through a floor or a bridge or off a cliff at least four times, maybe five, and all of them appear to be 25 feet (8 meters) or more...and there's never any kind of serious injury. Any one of these falls could kill a person, but would likely at least injure them pretty severely. But nope, not here. The protagonist just shakes it off and gets on with things like this is a normal occurrence (well, in the case of this game, I guess that it is :D). It's time to think of some other non-returnable transitions to the next area without yet another completely unrealistic fall. I don't expect too much realism in HOGs, but this was getting hilarious by the third time or so.  - THESE ARE THE WORST PUZZLES IN HISTORY. NO ONE LIKES THEM. STOP PUTTING THEM IN THESE GAMES. Really, this is always just an indication of \"we ran out of puzzle ideas, but needed one more, so let's throw in a sliding puzzle.\" It's lazy and irritating, and if there wasn't an achievement for not skipping any puzzles, I would skip this thing the second that button lit up. Blech. So, that may seem like a lot of bad and not so much good, but that's not true. All of the bad things were (mostly) specific moments in the game, and the good things were pretty consistent throughout the game. If you play a lot of HOGs, you could definitely do a lot worse than Darkarta, and chances are that you'll really enjoy your time in the game. There is an impressive amount of attention to detail in the graphics, and that alone kept me wondering what the upcoming crazy scene would look like and to where I would travel next. That makes Darkarta a solid HOG - thumbs-up from me. ______________ Note for achievement hunters: this game will most likely require two run-throughs if you want to 100% it. I find that irritating with HOGs because I don't feel the need to replay them once I've solved them. But, you'll probably need a slower run-through, paying close attention to find all of the morphing objects, solving the puzzles the first time, etc. Then, you'll need to do a speed run after that, skipping animations and puzzles, so that you can solve the main game under a time limit. It's an unusual achievement set-up for these kind of games, so I wanted to point that out for people like me that enjoy getting 100% of the achievements on any game where it doesn't mean 500 hours of time investment. :) ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

A completely new kind of killer, where you won't necessarily get any further with conventional methods. I don't think the sister is overly strong. However, it's pretty deadly in the right hands. I would put them on a par with the hillbilly (backwoods). But since their abilities work completely differently than those of the conventional killers, it is almost in a class of its own. It is even more difficult to play than the already difficult Hill Billy. You always have to keep in mind that the game is still being developed. Nothing is set in stone. Maybe a few more adjustments will follow. Unfortunately, I wasn't allowed to play the new map yet, but I'm looking forward to it. Unfortunately, and that's really not nice, there are still some persistent bugs. Like that you often have to try to join a lobby x times before it works. And sometimes bugs that affect the game for both killers and survivors. I would like to see more work on fixing than on further development. Even if I and many others are sure to be very happy about new content. The decision to make it possible for all players to see strange killers and survivors and maps in action even if you don't buy the DLC (if it shouldn't be free in the future) is right and good. The main game didn't cost the world, but I hope that the main game should be more or less finished at some point. The DLC's are reasonable in price.

{"text": "LIMBO meaning: edge, edge, indecision, uncertainty, uncertainty. In Catholicism, a place separate from heaven and hell, according to ancient Catholic doctrine, it was the place where the souls of children who died without baptism went and their souls would go to limbo, because they did not have the baptismal grace to go to heaven, but they had no personal sin to go to hell, the game itself has no plot or story, not even the characters have names. Just by understanding the concept and meaning of the word Limbo, it already gives you a feeling that you already know the game completely, lacking only a few more details, such as the fact that there are other children who kill it if you have the chance and strange creatures like spiders and flies (bigger than the kid), as well as the scenery changing very quickly, through forests, factories and hotels. My point of view of the game: Apparently Limbo for not having a story done, leaves a blank sheet for you to even imagine what is going on in the game, in the game the anonymous boy died by an accident on a ladder of a tree house (you you can see it in the game menu) the ladder is broken and there are 2 small swarms of flies on the floor, which may indicate that there are two bodies there, the boy's and the girl's, but we cannot reach that conclusion, because we don't know if the girl is really dead, since in the game itself, her eyes don't shine like the boy's and now you tell me \"there are other kids in limbo and their eyes don't shine\", You heard the saying that eyes are the windows of the soul? Probably yes. So this does not indicate that the people who are there with him have a soul or just that they are there to prevent you from completing your journey (In the game in question the boy lives a cycle of a journey that never ends) he starts the game and has a objective that we know is to find the girl, at the foot of the tree where he died. And when he reaches that goal he just starts all over again as if it were the first time trying. It's just you to unleash your creativity and try to understand the game's environment, it's fun because it looks like you made the game's story, and it really is, you do it and you share it, as I'm doing! The game already gives you that option because it doesn't have a clear history. That's it, this is my point of view on Limbo and I hope you like it and I recommend this game a lot to those who haven't played, it is worth every second in it.

Some puzzles/sequences are trial-and-errors that often end in the character's death and restarting which breaks the otherwise perfect (!) flow of the game.  (skip this if you're not interested in such) As you might have noticed I've praised the game a lot and that may raise a flag. I'm not a big fan of 2D walking simulators/platformers. This game took me by surprise and I forgot that it was such a game mechanically. The atmosphere of the game and the level of detail put by the developers are outstanding. On numerous ocassions I tried stuff just to test the developers only to be surprised by the fact that they've thought about this too! Some character interactions were surprisingly satisfying. From an audiophile perspective the sound design and execution were out of this world. There was a sequence where soundtrack, sounds and gameplay blended in one perfect moment that's still with me. Brilliant. At some point I was so immersed in the game world that certain sequences/environment made me gasp for a few seconds while I was processing what was happening. And so on but I stop here for the sake of not boring you more. If you liked what I'd stressed above, then just buy and play the game. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution itself is an extremely large-scale game, which I will not be able to talk about in detail in a short review. The Deus Ex series itself did not attract me at all, but somehow in the summer, when I saw that Human Revolution was being sold for 59 rubles, I had a sharp desire (and when I went through \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 to grab this creation. everything turned out to be amazing and at the same time I didn\u2019t get bored. True, sometimes the game was so difficult and demanding on my skills that I was scared to go into it. The main character is Adam Jensen (his name was like that), a former special forces soldier, and at the moment games, the security agent of the company he works for (it may sound strange, but how much time has passed since my passing). And one fine afternoon, the company building, in which Jensen was, is attacked. Who committed the attack. That's the plot! And now briefly about the main thing! Plot-9 of 10. Although it seemed a little confusing and drawn-out, it is still interesting, with twists of events and other things that are typical for modern games. -12 out of 10. I used to think that the most non-linear stealth action is Dishonored, but after passing it I realized that I was a moron, and that my friends were right. Deus Ex: Human Revolution cards, like anthills and labyrinths, keep secrets. The number of paths will double when pumping special skills (of which there are many). Music and World-10 out of 10. For lovers of the future, cyberpunk and other garbage, it is strictly advised to play this creation. The world is not only made interesting and stylish, but is complemented by atmospheric music. The final score is 9 out of 10. Despite such advantages, Deus Ex: Human Revolution still has disadvantages that spoil the impression of passing. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

{"text": "This is my first review that was written in serious cabbage soup, so do not judge strictly) I bought the game quite spontaneously, just by surprising it at a sale. I've heard a lot of things about the game: online question, entry threshold, etc. 1. Online. In the game, it keeps on a figure of about 8-10 thousand. This is completely enough to find almost any modes within 30 seconds. 2. Entry threshold. The threshold is quite high, at first it will seem to you that this is an ordinary casual shooter, but after playing for a while you will start to come across this game, these are fans who have been playing for more than the first or second year who just fly around the map and endure everything that is possible, like that what you decide is getting better or just leaving online. First of all, this is a \"Multiplayer arena-shooter\", but the game has a well-made campaign, you can't say that it was made just like that, but it does not pull 10/10 either. The company is interesting, but short, touching, but too simple. That's why many people buy this game, in Titanfall 2 there is a completely different game mechanics compared to any shooter. Sicked players who simply annihilate the entire map at first just seem to be the Gods of this game, but after playing 15 hours, I began to less understand the mechanics of the game and learn parkour. The Titans themselves deserve special attention, they are not imbalanced, but rather dilute, and so is a very dynamic gameplay. The game costs adequate money by today's standards, online on a PC is enough to search for ice rinks in 30-40 seconds, the entry threshold is high, but you don't need to be an esports player either. I give the game a score of 9/10. And is Titanfall 2 worth buying in 2020? Yes, it's worth it. P.S. \"As great a shooter as it is underrated.\" ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": false}

Yes, i gave my Bike a Name when i was young, like Agent Coulssen from SHIELD called his Car Lola. Anyway, in Times without Social Media or Internet we tried so many Stunts on them and the use of patches was very high. Godzilla was sometimes a little bit beastly, or i was too dumb for some stunts. Who knows? And yes, we also got a Film in that Times, called BMX BANDITS starring a very young Nicole Kidman. Good old 80\u00b4s. After that short not gaming Introduction, welcome to BMX-THE GAME. Yes, today BMX still has his Fans.  While Skateboarding has many Games like the Legendary Tony Hawk Skateboarding, you can search for BMX Games with a Magnifier. So i was suprised and excited to get this Game from the Developer, thank you very much. At first, don`t let my little playing Time fool you. I played over 10 Hours offline. Lets have a look at it. After starting the Game you find yourself in your Room. From here you have some Options.  IMPORTANT! Some of these Options  like the Tournament are momently not playable.

Yeah, i felt like 1984 when i tried my own stunts. The hurt way. Learning by doing i did some stunts and it was fun, but how do i say that, it feels a little bit clunky.  But not to forget, it is Early Access. It was truly fun to explore the City and yes, my Characters loves the Streets also, otherwise i could not describe while he was so often lying on them.

{"text": "At the time of writing this review, the game is still in Early Access. Zombie Party is a twin stick shooter in which you have to repel hordes of quite varied enemies, not just zombies as the title indicates. Mechanically the game is really competent, at first it can seem a bit overwhelming due to the amount of things that you have to pay attention to but as soon as you get used to the controls and the way the enemies move and attack the game becomes addictive. It is not simply dodging and shooting everything that moves, it is better to have a strategy and switch to the best weapon for each situation, managing the ammo is important so holding the trigger all the time is not the best idea. This way of playing is more evident in the Dungeon mode in which one has to kill the enemies of one level before moving on to the next and the levels are not simple arenas but more complex maps in which one can even find secret areas behind of destructible obstacles. The other modes are: Adventure: kill a certain number of waves of enemies followed by a boss and then go to a new level with another map and different enemies; Arcade - survive as long as possible and kill everything you can; Deathmatch: a vs mode in which you face other players, or bots. I could not test the local multiplayer mode, because for that you need other people :( As for the audiovisual part of the game it is\u2026 a bit difficult to process at times. The pixel-art is very well done and the visual effects are good , but more than once I found that everything was too bright or had too little contrast to understand what was going on. This ranges from not so important things like the text in some transitions is difficult to read because it is white on light colors at levels where some enemies can get lost in the background. The music is, as always, subjective to personal tastes (I liked it); although I can say that it goes according to the game: rather cheerful and energetic 8/10 ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": true}

{"text": "Since buying, I have played a total of 20 hours, and I have seen one large, promising update during that time.  If you are not familiar with crafting mechanics, this game may at first pose some problems for you, but it is, for the most part, a fairly forgiving and enjoyable experience even on Normal mode, and I can see it developing into something bigger and better as time goes on.  The latter statement I believe more wholeheartedly because the developers seem dedicated to listening to their players, and passionate about improving the game at a reasonable pace.  With any luck, and some hard work, they'll see Raft become an iconic staple in ocean survival games.   The bottom line is that fans of the survival genre will be delightfully surprised by the game's humble, simple premise.  You start on a raft made up of four wooden squares, given only a plastic hook on a rope, and your character's health, hunger and thirst to look out for.  Fortunately, the tides and the wind bring your raft past floating materials such as wood, plastic and leaves, and the ocean is abundant with fish and seagulls for the initiated hunter.  Such ingredients can be collected in between your journeys from island to island, and fashioned into parts for the raft, or tools for your character.   After a few hours, your raft may resemble something more akin to a ship, and eventually a floating home, with all (most) of the amenities of land.  It may even feel.. cozy, at some point. Everything in between those stages is up to you, and that freedom definitely makes Raft replayable as hell, even in its current stage.  All in all, probably about a 7/10 in its current form, and completely worth the entertainment cost of about 50 cents per hour that I paid.  Give it a shot. ", "voted_up": true, "early_access": true}

{"text": "Fun little game - I always had weakness for this type of games since Kula World on PSX, where you control a ball through a set of abstract levels and I really regret that Marble Blast Ultra, which is even more similar to Marble Skies (or vice versa), was eventually pulled off from the Xbox Live Arcade. The controls in Marble Skies are tight and precise, you can use both controller or mouse/keyboard configuration. The physics (marble weight, air control, spin momentum, etc.) are smooth and predictable, which is substantial in the genre, camera movement works fine as well. The level design is OK, nothing particularly amazing or surprisingly sophisticated, the obstacles are simply satisfying to get through and that's it. There are 100+ levels - developers promised to deliver more, it's not one of those \"forever Early Access\" games - all of various difficulty, but the challenge is always fair (there are checkpoints for more casual approach) and the progression feels quite balanced. Above that, collecting miscellaneous power-ups adds some additional spice. Marble Skies runs on Unreal Engine 4, but don't expect anything breathtaking - the game has its own pure, minimalistic visual style and perhaps that simplicity suddenly becomes its strong point. The sound department doesn't stand out with anything special either, it simply fulfills its basic role. The leaderboards exists, but currently they're inconvenient in use. There's also some kind of levelling system along with Daily Challenges where you get gems to exchange them for the cosmetics (such as marble skins), and while the idea in its essence is alright if delivered properly, somehow I had an impression it's not really needed here at all. Worth mentioning is the fact that Birdwall Games promised to implement a Multiplayer feature somewhere in the future. Personally I'm excited about the level editor with Workshop support, which would drastically improve longevity of the game in my eyes. I'm usually reluctant about writing reviews, but in the times when Steam is flooded with garbage software, I have an irresistible feeling that many decent indie titles are quite easily overlooked and rarely gets the recognition they deserve. Perhaps Marble Skies won't go down in video games history as something truly remarkable, nonetheless it shouldn't be completely forgotten by the 3D-platformer enthusiasts. Thumbs up!

It's like Minecraft, it's not about the graphics, it's about the creative possibilities.

After reading some of the reviews I find it disgusting that people COMPARE this game to Arma 3 or the Arma Series. Arma is a Military Simulator Sandbox which I can see why some people compare both games because well... its MILITARY. Comparing Squad to Arma is like comparing an Apple to a Peach. Yes they're both fruits but they taste completely different. Squad has set games modes and matches/rounds on servers. Arma 3 is a Military Sandbox and it can be modified to how a person would like it to be. Of Course Arma will offer more options such as Helicopters, Jets Mods etc. You won't be able to play Roleplay Servers on Squad like Arma or Make your own mission files on squad. Squad is not a Sandbox just a PvP Game that enforces a slower play by encouraging players to treat it tacticatly and to some extent \"Realisticly\".  That is all..

Later you can unlock more accesses to your roads and busses, with that you get a lot more customers - and money, of course. Another big part is the personal management. You need to hire cashiers, storemans, builders and so on. After you hired them, you need to give your employees a shift, so that they know when and how long they should work. Every of your stores has its own employees, so you need to hire cashiers and storemans for every single store. That can be boring with time but it's important for a well-functioning store.

{"text": "Dieselstormers: A Tale of Two Orks For every misguided youth of the last century who grew up on a healthy diet of Nintendo and Sega, run and gun platformers like the ubiquitous Contra were a staple of multiplayer gaming.  Long before the days of online first person shooters with dozens of players from around the globe, technologically primitive children like ourselves would gather around our ginormous radiation emitting square televisions, fighting each other for a chance to wield the controller next.  Everybody's household on a weekend was sort of like Lord of Flies, except we had to blow into cartridges before the mayhem could begin. , the latest effort from Black Forest Studios, is reminiscent of those old school multiplayer shooters of the past, but without the broken controllers (and friendships).  Despite having just entered Early Access on Steam,   is already quite polished for an alpha.  Stylistically, the game stands out with a uniquely detailed art style and beautiful, colorful backgrounds.  Weapons hit the various goblin enemies with a satisfying thud, and the controls are well executed with both keyboard and mouse and gamepad.  Though a full featured single player campaign is already included, the real meat of the game is in the cooperative multiplayer experience, supporting up to four players at a time. At the start of  , the player is taken to a main area which houses both their main crafting inventory and the mission selection portal.  The first weapon given is a weak, ineffectual pistol, but with the completion of each successful mission another gun part and crafting piece is unlocked.  Missions are short, generally taking around 5-10 minutes to complete.  Multiplayer progress carries over to single player, so players are free to jump between modes as they choose. Intriguingly, in multiplayer, your character remains alive at \"death\", though with diminished powers and barely the ability to push enemies back.  Upon a player finding a health pick up, the deceased will be revived.  What's most interesting is that death is not necessarily the end if both players die, as long as some sort of health can be found.   Of course, it must be remembered the game is early access and is still a bit buggy at the moment.  During our multiplayer sessions, we had a few crashes and a bit of slowdown, but considering that this is an early alpha, the game shows great promise.  Despite the minor issues we encountered, we found   to be quite enjoyable.   For the adventurous, the developers allow work in progress levels to be toggled in the options menu, what they call \"construction site mode\".  As the developers jokingly proclaim on the options page, \"unfinished content can look like an ork's backside and play like its underpants.  You have been warned.\"  It's nice to see a developer with a sense of humor, and of course   plays quite well, even in its early state.  Of course, it's not Black Forest Games' first foray into the platformer genre, having developed the recent Giana Sisters titles.  Expect   to only improve as time goes on.  succeeds in bringing back that old school platformer vibe, and is the kind of game you can play over and over again with your friends, whether it be in bite sized sessions or for hours on end.

{"text": "So, this is, in fact, a review for the Early Access version, but what will be in the full version will be clear when the full version is released. In short: 1) Excellent mechanics of ground and space battles, with boarding, tasks and interesting mechanics of capturing points. 2) Good sane AI if you have few players on the server. And there may be few of them. because the ceiling is 32 players per team. 3) A flexible system of customizing equipment for yourself, as well as the presented equipment, but at the same time the balance of weapons is not very good and there is no breakdown by weapon class. I already have a habit from other shooters, which are main and auxiliary, but here this breakdown is not. Not in terms of pistols, but rifles and machine guns as an example. Even by class in the form of energy or small arms. You can, of course, go through the studies and more or less understand the weapon, but the simplest division by function will help much more. As an option, the shooting gallery and everything is presented there, but at the same moment you will have to enter the shooting gallery. 4) Great cards. But at the same time, due to the fact that the game is in early access, that is, its own glitches, bugs and flaws in the maps. But at the same moment these glitches are slowly removed and soon it will go away from the minuses. 5) The lack of the Russian language, although this does not really interfere with the game, but at the same moment you quickly understand what needs to be done or understand what kind of equipment you are using. The game has a pumping system somewhat different from that observed in most similar games. All weapons and all attachments are available to players immediately. But at the same time, players are limited in terms of various kinds of points, of which there are three types: Battle Points, Support Points, Team Points. The first are awarded for military actions in the form of killing and destroying the accursed adversaries, the second - for supporting the team with boxes of equipment and in any other way, and the third - for the execution of orders given to you and for the correct use of your own squad, if you are its commander. The mechanics of the battles work perfectly well - the class system is completely absent in the game, so your role on the battlefield is determined by what you took with you. The ceiling is limited by the number of points available to you, the number of which increases as you level up. Thus, the evil veteran will differ from the green rookie only in the body kit that he can afford. What, in my opinion. more honest. And more fun. Until you understand how to properly configure your weapon, you will curse everything, and after that it is not very clear about the landing, and then you just appear on the battlefield automatically. And if you are interested in space battle on a fighter, but in the same ground battle in the form of the simplest infantry, then the game is for you. The game is constantly being improved and slightly changed, supplementing with just the necessary things. Previously, there was no training, but it appeared and they already explain what to do, but the dialogue is not very clear and spend some of the time to understand how to read or leaf through this dialogue.

{"text": "For every player who asked, \"How would Risk of Rain look in 3D?\"   This sequel is the answer. It has everything that RoR has but more \u2013 such as the new characters Artifacer and MUL-T. They also have new items like Lunar coins, new enemies (I.e Beetle Guard) and additional stages like the Newt Alter that takes you to the Bazaar.  Now the visuals are quite minimalistic, with flat 3D colors that makes the environment look more like it was designed using highlighters. However, I see this as a perfect fit to the combat and action as it can get quite chaotic as the level progresses. Any RoR players can attest to this, remembering how much of a clusterf**k it became in the later levels. I'm quite impressed at how well the developers re-designed some enemies from the prequel. The basic Rock Golems to the Greater Wisp and Imps all looks great!   Animations are smooth and fluid through the gameplay in my experience. My only concern is the bug that occurs when spawning in the Bazaar, as I had 1-2 times where my character appeared outside of the spawn point. Plus the occasional enemy or missile chipping through a wall. As for effects, you'd better believe they exist; especially when the entire map turns red, the grounds starts to rumble and you realize that another player has activated the Teleporter.    The audios are there, and just as fantastic as the art.  Since the game is still in Early Access, I'm hoping they'll bring back some more of the old characters and monsters from RoR.    Additional note for funnies, is the way they name the levels.   The final level is \"AHAHAHAHAHA [\u2026]\" lol (Corrected by commentor).

Before getting into group battles (2-br / 5-br), play for 5-10 hours in zombie solo br (50 players with a huge map where there will be more loot and everyone will be able to get lost) 2. A car is a very necessary item except for a solo zombie br (there are no cans of gasoline) found a car? immediately fly away on it in search of new cars (take gasoline from them) and loot in remote places from the spawn =) 3. Did you see the car? one should not rejoice in advance, since there may not be a candle there (without a candle it will not start) what to do? score on the car (the best option) or sit down and wait for the owner of the car (not the fact that he will come) 4. Did you see the airdrop? do not fly there faster than anyone (usually there is almost nothing on 1 drop + there is a chance of an ambush) 5. While running to the safe, did the smoke cover the zone? it doesn't matter if we use the medical kit and run further (hp cannot go down because of a strong heal of hp) 6. You will burn if you play 2-br / 5-br with left people! why? 99% chance they will kill you for loot or fun 7. Tired of your fingers from running? press \"+\" and the character will run automatically (you can move away or close the game, he will run further) Bottom line: Now you are ready to plunge into H1Z1 and start bending down How to do this?

The game also does not instruct the player on how to do basic essentials \u2013 like opening up inventory, how to craft, how to view the map, where the compass is, how to heal, where to find gear and weapons, etc. All of these variables add up to a learning curve that chews up and spits out bloodied and mangled new players.

In Warband, with a non-player character we talked to for the task, we could not say that we could actually talk much. Both sides stood opposite each other, looking and talking in a way that resembled the long gaze scenes in Turkish TV series. In Bannerlord, they can show their joy with both speech and body language, or they can trip like the lovers we forgot to buy gifts on Valentine's Day. There are 6 states in the game; these are Empire, Vlandia, Battania, Sturgia, Khuzait and Aserai. Each of them lives in a different geography and has different cultures. Atmosphere was great before going too long. Many structures on the map such as arenas, horse-drawn carriages, castle gates, and adobe houses look very beautiful. The animations are also very good, especially the fall of the enemy you killed according to your strike, and the body movements of the horses while running and turning look delicious.

{"text": "I loved this game, honestly. I spent a bit of time on it. I built a couple worlds up, and I enjoyed it. I spent quite a bit of time on each one, making them all a little different, and I played with my friends in the privated worlds.  Then the next update comes a bit after the Golden Age, and I see \"Patch R33 Now Live!\" I was pretty excited about this patch, as I already knew it would bring in new things like automation and machines. So I read through it and I saw \"We've been trying to figure out a way to make this game Pay 2 Play er- I mean... Trying to figure out how to fairly charge our players, and we came up with Creativerse Pro!\" Now what I SAW in the actual patch notes was, \"Creativerse Pro players now will get a Glider, a Flashlight, and a bigger inventory.\" I didn't really care about anything except the inventory, that did tick me off a bit when I saw it. However, I could deal with it. What I COULD NOT DEAL WITH is the fact that when I booted up my game, I was restricted from touching any advanced world settings, ESPECIALLY after I was really looking forward to messing around with them because I knew that new settings were introduced in the same R33 patch. However, I still had hope for the game, because I still enjoyed it. What made me simply stop playing this game was when I tried to click \"Create New World\" and a pop-up advertisement shouted in my face, \"BUY CREATIVERSE PRO FOR THIS FEATURE TO UNLOCK!\" At that moment, I lost all hope on the game. It had now turned from a fun, enjoyable F2P game to a P2P. Point and Case, I would love to recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed crafting survival games, like Minecraft but much better, but I simply can't do that anymore. This was a great game, but DO NOT EVEN DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. It simply isn't worth downloading at this point. Save your own time, and go look for something else, because the label \"Free To Play\" on this game has faded away already, while still in early access, and beneath it is now \"Pay To Play\".

Even the best gears can't save you of taking sniper shot from unknown direction, from far away, ending your match in a sudden. Looting and roaming the map takes huge part of your play time in the game.  Gameplay shooting is not bad. I like having mixture of TPS and FPS. Also the TPP(third-person perspective) and ADS(aim-down sights) combinations attracted me as well.But there are still room for improvements. Regarding developers many improvements will be delivered for final game release. I've got the game only because of the great amount of viewers on Twitch. But lately I have realized that this game is not for me. Is not what I've been looking for.  For streamers this game is great as there is a time where you can spend time to response to chat and there is a time where you should be more focused in game.

Consider this:  Most of the time you are just about to loot the first place you've drop. Then run away towards middle of the circle. Where you are about to prone waiting for the final circle. At this moment you are about remain prone. The other way is to just drop where is the most popular by players dropping and trying to kill as much as possible of them. Keep in mind, luck have a lot to do with your final perfomance. And is involved in your satisfaction of the game. Like, if you think you can go for long kill streak. It doesn't work that way. Some times you can find good gears. Some times you can't find any gears that suits you best. Not just for the first drop, even till match end for you. One of the aspect I don't like of PUBG, is about having only one chance. And also you are not able to revenge. Only if you play in a group and you've got killed. Your friend/s can revenge you. Continue in this sense, the game feels better if you play regularly with friends than going solo. However if you playing all games solo, you are going to like it (in case everything above it's fine for you), because you are free of not following someone's path or stick to same gameplay every time. VISUAL ----------- Game is developed on Unreal 4 Enging. Means visually should be a masterpiece. Unfortunatelly for me the game does not look like one. Even there are some gross textures. Developers barely have put some sort of effort to make the game have stunning look. At least the characters looks fine. Speaking about characters. There are good amount of customizations. I guess they will keep this trend.  WEAPONS --------------- About weapon customizations. There are just a ready presets attachments so far in early access of the game. Not all attachments are available to all weapons. There are weapons without having option to attach scope. In my opinion in order to start feel the game you need to have at least 50 h of gameplay. Like having played with each weapon(common) at least once. Or drop at almost every popular location. GAMEPLAY ---------------- Driving key of continue playing is the feeling you can make it better next time. But me personaly, once I've tooked my chicken dinner I stop worry about this and every next match became the same as previous one.  If you still reading and thinking of getting the game. Keep in mind the gameplay skills does not have a huge path, but does requires a huge patience. You need to learn stuff like taking positions, how to move at certain time of the match. Shooting skills with most common and preffered weapons. Distance, recoil and bullet deviation are stuff you have to learn. Recognizing player's characters in distance and in foliege in your vicinity. In overall do I recommend this game. No if you looking for action. Yes if you looking for more slow pace gameplay and huge tension. Like litterary at the final circle the game is a lot tense. I hope this review gave a bit of a sense of the game. You can also check out one of my gameplay video. ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": true}

Become a bank robber, a drugdealer, a serial killer or be just the guy next door. Let me just start with saying that this game in is Early Access and looking at the game how it is at the moment I surely hope it will stay in Early Access for now, The idea is good, the result so far is not so good. There are a bunch of serious performance issues, I played the game for about half an hour a died twice because I couldn't walk anymore because of the lag, I took on the role as a mass murderer and started killing everything that came in side. Eventually I was very wanted and the police came for me but when I started stacking body's the game just couldn't handle it, it became extremely laggy and eventually the game just freezes. The world is designed in a very minimalistic way, because of this the map looks really empty and boring and not very inviting to start exploring. Same with the buildings you can enter everything but they are basicly just empty shells with nothing in them. I really like the idea and really hope the dev(s) can and will fix the issues, It has the potential as a very fun game but as of now I will give it a thumbs down. I will come back to this in a few months to see if there is any improvement but I have a feeling that this game has been abandoned. If they do fix the problems and turn it into a better playable game I will reconsider to give it a thumbs up. Pros: - Large open world - Almost every building can be entered - Simple controls - Fun concept, could turn into a really fun game Cons: - Long loading times sometimes - Horrible performance issues, both on the lowest and highest settings, extreme lag when you kill a few people in the same     place. - Terrible Graphics, Polygone style gone wrong, little effort has gone into placing buildings and trees in a natural way. - NPC's all look like stickmans and only have the most basic of functions, some run away when they see you with a gun,     the guy mawing the lawn couldn't care less and almost asks to be killed. They have no faces, they have no gender, and     only some of them say very basic stuff (vendors) - If the NPC's say something you can expect a few spelling errors. - The gore used in this game is not inline with the polygone style, it looks weird and doesn't fit the game. - No options, no way to get out of the game in a normal way - No achievements, No Tradingcards This game is for an adult audience the game includes: Guns Gore Drugs Violence small amount of racism small amount of sexual content ", "voted_up": false, "early_access": true}

Everything is amazing, customization, combat style, npc conversations (The first game with npc convo that I've NEVER skipped BEFORE)  The best part about this game is that it has such enormous potential that it could possibly KILL other mmos.  Now comes the fun part, the ranked matches are fine, but please add a REPORT SYSTEM.  It is crucial that the game has such features so it will prevent players from LEAVING the match halfway like an idiot.  AND NOW THE FINALE, please PLEASE remove the Capture The Flag MODE.

Kurtzpel team, please for the love of god remove or patch the gamemode. Here are my suggestions, when the flag bearer is punched or attacked multiple times, the flag drops and is needed to be picked up again with maybe reduced duration. It would make this gamemode PLAYABLE and NOT \"BROKEN\". I believe that the Kurtzpel community would want that too, I hope this game does not die like mmos usually do. Please, do something about this.  The end.

NEGATIVE: there is allot of things wrong with this game but i will mention just some. its pay to win for most people that would be enough to stop playing something but not for me, bascly if you wanna spend some money on this game you can unlock everything in forward and be OP and pretty much wreck the opponents that the game gives you. saw some tehnical issues that the game has dating from 2015(for those that dont know the game exist from 2015 on consoles) and they havent fixed the yet and its 2017 that i am making this review, but mostly why my reason of making this negative review is exploits, they exist from 2015, and the worst part is if you search on google for exploits you will find tons of them and many of those exploits date to 2015 and if you try them out they still work... FINAL:  if you dont care about exploits, pay to win, and just wanna play a game that you can spend hours and hours and not to worry about waiting for a building to finish building and that sort of things then this is a game for you, but if you hate those 2 main things then i suggest not to waste your time on it.
